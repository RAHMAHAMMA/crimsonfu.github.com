title: Transparency in open source projects

I published an [article][] about transparency in the open source project I work on in my day job (Dataverse).

I mention having a publicly logged IRC channel and #crimsonfu was my proving ground for this concept. I continue to find these logs very useful and they contribute to "building a knowledge base accessible by any search engine," as I say in the article.

I probably could have explained more that I think sysadmins installing software for the first time benefit finding answers in email archives, but maybe that goes without saying.

I talk a bit about challenges to transparency in terms of security.

Feedback is welcome!
