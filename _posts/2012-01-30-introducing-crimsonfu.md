crimsonfu is a group of sysadmins who code.

Founded in early 2012, we are still defining ourselves, but here are a few of our guiding principles:

* Strength in Numbers
* Open Source by Default
* [When in Doubt, Make it Public](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2007/04/when-in-doubt-make-it-public.html)

"Crimson" is in our name because we met while working at Harvard, but we will avoid insularity and hope to slowly attract a diverse membership.

"Fu" is a nod to http://commandlinefu.com

Among other things, we do some **C**onfigu**R**at**I**on **M**anagement of **S**ystems **O**r **N**etwork kung **FU**.
