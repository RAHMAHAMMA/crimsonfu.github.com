12:15 pdurbin where is http://crimsonfu.github.io/members/tfhartmann when I need him? :)
12:16 pdurbin remember when he invited us all to join the Slack channel he created? http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2015-03-10
12:16 pdurbin and I was whining about data liberation and lack of public logs?
12:18 pdurbin jinora may be a solution: "Slack webhook app to create anonymous public channels" https://github.com/sdslabs/jinora
12:18 pdurbin "jinora is a simple slack-backed chat application that proxies messages to and fro between slack and an anonymous chat platform. It allows your team to maintain a #public channel where anonymous users can come and talk to your entire team."
12:19 pdurbin I heard about it at https://botbot.me/freenode/opensourcedesign/2015-03-29/?msg=35325380&page=1
12:20 pdurbin hmm, the demo at https://chat.sdslabs.co is not quite what I expect though...
12:20 pdurbin I was expecting to see public logs. Instead I was prompted to log in. Hmm, so it's more of a replacement for https://www.olark.com it seems...
12:22 pdurbin i.e. a way for users/customers to contact you via chat
12:22 pdurbin anonymously
16:58 larsks  If you're a vim user, this is an interesting take on things: https://github.com/mawww/kakoune
