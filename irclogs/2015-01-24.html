18:17 hydrajump interesting backup project https://attic-backup.org/ anyone using it?
18:22 pdurbin   never heard of it but sounds nice
18:57 dotplus   you harvardites (harvardians? not sure of the correct term that is analagous to Oxonian, I'm sure you have  one). You're sort of in the HPC and/or bio-informatics world, right? There's someone I "know" from another channel who has that sort of experience and is currently interested in getting a .edu position. Should I bring him here? Or would one of you be willing to talk to him privately?
22:09 pdurbin   dotplus: sure. send him in
