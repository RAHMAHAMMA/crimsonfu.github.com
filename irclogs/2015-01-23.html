00:28 pdurbin  semiosis: I take it you use ZF2
00:33 pdurbin  this seems like it's a whole thing
16:33 pdurbin  I just upgraded the cert from SHA-1 to SHA-256 at https://apitest.dataverse.org but Chrome says "The identity of this website has been verified by InCommon RSA Server CA but does not have public audit records." Based on http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/52834/what-exactly-does-it-mean-when-chrome-reports-a-certificate-does-not-have-public-audit-records I guess I'm not too concerned, however.
16:34 pdurbin  Seems like a new thing: http://www.certificate-transparency.org
17:00 semiosis pdurbin: yep, zf2. it's great
17:01 pdurbin  better than all the crazy java stuff I use? :)
17:02 semiosis different tools for different jobs
17:02 pdurbin  yeah
21:52 pdurbin  I guess everyone is fine with the cert thing. It's just Chrome being picky, it seems. :)
