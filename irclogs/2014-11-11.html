14:38 pdurbin  nice quote from mattdm: "Please join me in asking Groupon to change their plans" at Help the GNOME Foundation defend the GNOME trademark - http://gnome.org/groupon/
17:29 semiosis pdurbin: re: jmeter, yes i have
17:29 semiosis it's a pain, but it can be useful
18:29 pdurbin  semiosis: I played with it a bit. Seems useful, powerful, complex.
18:58 semiosis some things that should be easy, like controlling a remote agent, are extremely difficult
18:58 semiosis iirc
18:59 pdurbin  in practice we're using Selenium instead: https://github.com/IQSS/selenium-helper
18:59 semiosis maybe in the last couple years it's gotten better
18:59 semiosis nice.  we use selenium too.  it's great
19:00 semiosis but that's more for acceptance testing.  i used jmeter for load testing
19:00 semiosis i tried doing acceptance tests in jmeter but it just seemed unnecessarily difficult to build the test routines
19:01 pdurbin  we're using Selenium to try to trigger a particular bug
19:01 semiosis imho i would use jmeter for testing Java EE stuff, like JMS, for which there are built in connectors
19:01 semiosis for http/web stuff i think there's better tools than jmeter
21:13 pdurbin  "UPDATE: After additional conversations with the open source community and the Gnome Foundation, we have decided to abandon our pending trademark applications for “Gnome.” We will choose a new name for our product going forward." https://engineering.groupon.com/2014/misc/gnome-foundation-and-groupon-product-names/
21:13 pdurbin  all's well that ends well
21:24 larsks   It's funny that the news comes out of the engineering department. I suspect they had some internal pressure as well as external...
22:55 pdurbin  I hear the new name is going to be KDE.
