12:11 pdurbin   SimKlabnik 2000 on Twitter: "Don't get me wrong, I like Slack's UI too. But watching technologists flock to it rather than improve the UI of IRC clients makes me sad." - https://twitter.com/steveklabnik/status/578625267553333248
12:11 hydrajump cool. Also with regards to talky there's https://free.gotomeeting.com/

17:13 pdurbin   is it weird to allow a # character in file names? should we disallow it?
18:55 larsks    pdurbin: I like '#' in filenames.  It lets me differentiate in logs between "#rdo" the channel and "rdo" the user.
19:13 pdurbin   true
19:13 pdurbin   that's how my client (weechat) logs stuff
