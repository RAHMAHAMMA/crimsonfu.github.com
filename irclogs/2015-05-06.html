02:32 pdurbin   heh
02:32 pdurbin   just a branch, not shuff himself
13:21 dotplus   I'm considering toying with some new languages for the enlightenment aspect of exposure to foreign concepts. I think I'd like to approach this in a practical way: with a series of (tiny) projects initially aimed at gaining familiarity with the language's ecosystem/tooling/std libraries (as opposed to the language *itself*) and only then pick some projects that take advantage of/show off the strengths of the language.
13:21 dotplus   phase one would basically be the same for each language. phase two would not. Any suggestions for phase 1?
13:22 dotplus   something bigger than hello world, but still counting as tiny.
13:26 pdurbin   dotplus: I'd love it if you would contribute to https://github.com/pdurbin/addressbookmvc
13:30 dotplus   you have a spec of some kind for the result? something that specifies what the code *should* do?
13:31 pdurbin   dotplus: no, but please open an issue for this if you want!
13:31 dotplus   I'm guessing, but the broad answer is "create a (REST?) apiserver for an addressbook app"? Is that at least correct?
13:31 pdurbin   dotplus: the REST part is optional
13:31 pdurbin   prologic: right?
13:32 pdurbin   dotplus: I haven't merged his in yet: https://github.com/prologic/addressbookmvc
13:52 pdurbin   dotplus: what languages are you considering?
13:53 dotplus   pdurbin: all of them?
13:58 dotplus   seriously, in no particular order: erlang(elixir?), prolog, go, at least one lisp, lua, R, rust/nim, nodejs all sound interesting in their own ways.
14:00 dotplus   my "work" languages are python, perl, ruby, shell and there's no reason I couldn't choose one or more of them as an "enlightenment" target. It's not like I'm a real programmer:)
14:03 dotplus   I mean, I can and do get things done in those languages, but there's plenty of room for me to learn more/better ways of doing things in those languages too.
14:05 pdurbin   dotplus: those all sound interesting to me too
14:16 pdurbin   maybe not lua ;)
15:13 pdurbin   dotplus: pick one and go for it, I guess
15:16 dotplus   that's really the only way. It might make sense for me to do another (non-Circuits, sorry prologic) python implementation to get used to what the goal is first, since I know python reasonably.
15:16 dotplus   then it would probably be go or elixir/erlang.
15:17 dotplus   But I'd love to have issues #4 solved first:)
15:17 dotplus   at least partly.
15:18 pdurbin   dotplus: thanks so much for making that issue
15:18 pdurbin   here's where the conversation started: http://irclog.greptilian.com/friendlyjava/2015-03-28#i_105286
