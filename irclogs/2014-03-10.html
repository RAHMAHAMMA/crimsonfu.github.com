20:04 semiosis  someone with job description "Content writer and editor" told me that "We normally use numerals for web copy" in the context of regular written English... like "there are two kinds of people"
20:04 semiosis  meaning if that text is on the web, it would be "there are 2 kinds of people"
20:04 semiosis  does that make sense to anyone???

20:12 hydrajump hi
20:13 hydrajump Quick awk question. I have this â€º echo "eee fff ddd gggg" | awk '{$1=$2=""; print $0}'
20:13 hydrajump the output is "  ddd gggg". I wonder how to get rid of the leading space.
20:15 semiosis  echo "eee fff ddd gggg" | awk '{$1=$2=""; print $0}' | cut -c 3-
20:15 semiosis  but i have a feeling that's not what you're looking for :)
20:16 hydrajump semiosis it works
20:16 hydrajump don't know if it's pretty but so what if the result is good
