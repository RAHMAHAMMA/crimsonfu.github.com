01:28 mhayden   pdurbin: erhmagerd we're linkedin buddies now
01:31 pdurbin   woo!
01:32 pdurbin   mhayden: oh hey, I've been meaning to ask you how you get photos and videos off your Nexus 5 and into iPhoto or wherever you keep them
01:37 mhayden   i have photos auto-backup via btsync
01:37 mhayden   they end up on my nas and i can move them around from there
01:45 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky btsync
01:45 searchbot pdurbin: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BitTorrent_Sync
01:45 pdurbin   mhayden: once they're on your nas, do you delete them from your phone? I'm running out of space.
01:45 mhayden   generally, yeah
01:45 mhayden   i'm laxy about that part :)
01:45 mhayden   i'll usually go in and delete my oldest stuff from the phone
01:49 pdurbin   but after you've deleted stuff from your phone... and do another sync... the photos are still safely on your nas, I assume. they don't get wiped out
01:50 pdurbin   this seems to be a pretty good intro to all of this: http://john.sh/blog/2013/7/22/backing-up-android-with-bittorrent-sync-and-titaniumbackup
01:51 mhayden   well, remember that sync *will* remove files ;)
01:51 pdurbin   yeah, I would think. so...
01:52 pdurbin   don't delete anything from my phone? ;)
02:00 pdurbin   I mean, it sounds like a nice way to get stuff off the phone.
02:01 pdurbin   but when you go to free space on your phone you have a new problem
02:04 mhayden   yeah... the other option might be dropbox sync
02:04 mhayden   or google plus photo backup
02:06 pdurbin   that google plus thing freaks me out... automatically upload every photo you take directly to google? no thank you. I like the btsync idea better. I just want to get the stuff into iphoto on my wife's imac.
02:12 mhayden   could always write a script to rsync files from that btsync directory elsewhere
02:12 * mhayden is headed to sleep
02:13 pdurbin   for now I'm copying files to the imac. then importing them into iphoto. would be nice if iphoto recognized the nexus 5 as a camera
02:14 pdurbin   copying 10.5 GB of stuff. i'm sure all these photos are awesome
02:16 pdurbin   mhayden: thanks
02:50 pdurbin   ah so according to http://www.howtogeek.com/192732/android-usb-connections-explained-mtp-ptp-and-usb-mass-storage/ PTP stands for Picture Transfer Protocol but this option (Camera PTP) doesn't seem to help. iPhoto can't recognize my Nexus 5 as a camera
02:58 JoeJulian I've always just used scp.
03:02 pdurbin   oh wait, maybe it *does* detect it as a camera. this poor old imac is choking on the ~3500 photos on my phone though
03:02 pdurbin   actually, wait, more like 1600
03:03 pdurbin   ok, so this might not be so bad, this PTP mode
03:03 pdurbin   if the imac stops beachballing
12:46 pdurbin   when in doubt, reboot your 90 AWS instances: https://botbot.me/freenode/positivepython/2014-09-04/?msg=21004439&page=1
20:07 mhayden   that's... scary
20:16 pdurbin   :)
