02:43 pdurbin     this seems cool: 'There is a new project starting up called "Arch Women" Its a group for female Arch Linux users and the guys who support them. :) The main goal is to make the arch community easier for women to get involved in.' -- https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1180744
13:04 larsks      pdurbin: Those sound like people who don't hang out on #archlinux, which is apparently populated solely by rude teenager boys.
13:05 pdurbin     i've never been in #archlinux
13:13 jimi_c      It's not like #fedora or #ubuntu are any better
13:15 pdurbin     :(
13:16 jimi_c      http://www.penny-arcade.com/comic/2004/03/19 &lt;- explains everything
13:17 pdurbin     ah yes... http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/greater-internet-fuckwad-theory
13:19 larsks      jimi_c: #fedora is *substantially* better.
13:19 larsks      There's active moderation there, and they require registered nicks, which immediately cuts down on some of the worst of the crap.
13:19 larsks      Sure, not all of it.
13:19 larsks      But it's a step up.
13:23 jimi_c      maybe it has improved, it has been a while since I've been in either, but there was definitely a time you'd be called an idiot if you asked a basic question in there
13:24 jimi_c      but this is a group that did name their last release "Beefy Miracle" ;)
13:26 pdurbin     according to https://gist.github.com/nyux/aa55651de42818f6f971 rule number 1 for #archlinux-newbie is "don't be an ass"
14:08 larsks      #archlinux-newbie is brand new as of last week.  Hopefully they'll cultivate a friendlier environment there.
14:08 StripeyType pdurbin : which was the Nexus7 keyboard/case you really liked?
14:10 pdurbin     StripeyType: i've only had a few days to play with it: Amazon.com: MiniSuit Google Nexus 7 Bluetooth Keyboard Stand Case (Slim Rubberized Non-Slip Grip Back): Computers &amp; Accessories - http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B009WSCW4S/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=B009WSCW4S&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=thecommandl0a-20
14:10 pdurbin     the keys are too small, in my opinion. and it's not like i have huge sausage fingers
14:10 pdurbin     but it makes a nice protector to clamp on to the screen if you want to throw it in a bag
14:12 StripeyType My fingers are big and sausage-y, but having a physical keyboard is a really nice thing, even so. I lament that I can't seem to find a similar product for the Nexus4.
14:12 StripeyType thanks for the pointer.
14:24 pdurbin     larsks: didn't know #archlinux-newbie was new. +1 for friendliness
16:26 codex       StripeyType, pdurbin: the best keyboard that i've seen to date for android is this: http://www.amazon.com/Motorola-Wireless-Keyboard-Retail-Packaging/dp/B004L9MBH6/ref=sr_1_6?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1363019157&amp;sr=8-6&amp;keywords=android+keyboard
16:27 codex       all the other ones suffer from one of two problems: they break within 6-8 months, or they end up making your wrists/hands hurt (b/c of size, spacing, etc...)
16:28 semiosis    whats the deal with wireless keyboards on airplanes?
16:37 codex       you can't have one?
16:37 * codex     doesn't take airplanes
16:39 semiosis    must be nice
16:44 codex       :) absolutely
16:44 codex       old job was the complete opposite, but even there I managed to do everything remotely
16:44 codex       but yea, people there flew to utah/vegas once every 2-3 weeks (usually for 4-5 days)
22:27 JoeJulian   I was using a bluetooth keyboard on the planes coming back from Red Hat Summit last year. Was I not supposed to?
22:28 pdurbin     JoeJulian: you should have been paying attention to the crew member's instructions
22:51 JoeJulian   I couldn't. I was on my computer.
22:53 JoeJulian   I love how nobody actually turns anything off anymore. They don't even put their phone in airplane mode before they drop it in their carry-on. Same for tablets. The FAA should really change that rule so their other rules don't get lumped in with the "they don't know" mentality.
