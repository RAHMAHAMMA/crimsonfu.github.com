21:36 melodie     hello
23:04 pdurbin     melodie: hi. what's up?
23:05 melodie     pdurbin hi, I am discussing with slystone about "what kind of logs are there for #lpic-fr and where can they be seen?"
23:05 pdurbin     semiosis: maybe I *should* switch to kubuntu: http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2014-10-15#i_80316
23:05 melodie     I read a wikipedia page about the computer buses today
23:06 pdurbin     buses are good
23:06 melodie     pdurbin what is the point for you in switching to kubuntu?
23:06 melodie     Ubuntu does not use Kde natively, and you are a Fedora user, so what about trying Mageia, or Mandriva which are Kde natively?
23:07 melodie     not that I like KDE... well, all desktops need their users :D
23:07 pdurbin     I'm just trying to stir the pot. :)
23:11 melodie     to stir I stirred stirred (what does stir mean?)
23:12 pdurbin     searchbot: lucky stir the pot
23:12 searchbot   pdurbin: http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Stir+the+pot
23:13 pdurbin     http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/stir_the_pot http://www.usingenglish.com/reference/idioms/stir+the+pot.html
23:16 melodie     pdurbin I see. so what's your usual desktop anyway?
23:17 pdurbin     Mac at work (where I had the trouble I linked to), Fedora at home.
23:18 Mo0O        hi there
23:19 melodie     pdurbin I just invited Mo0O who could be interested to communicate here with people
23:20 Mo0O        hi pdurbin, thanks
23:20 pdurbin     Mo0O: everyone is welcome! "None of us is as smart as all of us" http://crimsonfu.github.io
23:20 Mo0O        I'm on melodie ;)
23:21 melodie     :)
23:22 JoeJulian   Punctuation, or it gets uncomfortably suggestive.
23:23 JoeJulian   :)
23:23 melodie     hi JoeJulian
23:23 JoeJulian   Hello melodie.
23:23 melodie     where are you from?
23:23 JoeJulian   Seattle
23:25 melodie     ok, so it's early at your place
23:25 melodie     and no sharks either
23:25 melodie     (read the news about Alabama beaches crowded with sharks)
23:26 JoeJulian   4:25pm and the Puget Sound is home to some of the largest sharks, but they're friendly.
23:26 melodie     here it's paste 1 am so I'm going to head to bed
23:26 melodie     the Puget Sound? Oh ok
23:26 melodie     see you around next
23:26 melodie     good afternoon!
23:26 JoeJulian   A bientot.
23:27 melodie     À bientôt
23:27 * JoeJulian doesn't have all those fancy accent keys.
23:31 Mo0O        JoeJulian: she said "see you" which in french without accent is "a bientot" ;)
23:31 pdurbin     erika!
23:31 pdurbin     spammed by my 5 year old. sorry
23:31 JoeJulian   hehe
23:32 JoeJulian   Mo0O: Thanks, I got that as I said it first without the accents because my us keyboard layout makes typing accents way too difficult.
23:33 Mo0O        JoeJulian: me too, I use the compose key to make accent
23:33 JoeJulian   Nifty little tidbit... The second largest shark in the world is a filter feeder and some do live here near Seatle.
23:35 Mo0O        scrary
23:35 Mo0O        scary*
23:36 JoeJulian   Not at all. Being filter feeders they're not dangerous, are actually quite curious, and often come swim with divers.
23:37 * JoeJulian always finds it amazing that the largest creatures often eat the smallest things.
23:37 pdurbin     piranhas are curious too
23:39 JoeJulian   pfft.. every piranha I've seen is timid. Oscars, now those will happily bite your finger tip off.
23:40 pdurbin     they sound groucy
23:40 JoeJulian   hehe
23:41 JoeJulian   You're just pulling out all the idioms today.
23:51 pdurbin     JoeJulian: how "former" is this former job of yours anyway?
23:51 JoeJulian   June 1
23:52 pdurbin     hmm
23:52 JoeJulian   but my son still works there.
23:53 * pdurbin   looks at linkedin
23:53 pdurbin     ah
23:53 pdurbin     somehow I forgot about this. new gig good?
23:55 JoeJulian   Yeah, it's pretty cool. We're completely redesigning the entire system, so I get to make a lot of design decisions.
23:55 JoeJulian   ... and I'm learning salt and ceph.
23:56 pdurbin     you were just complaining about people re-doing stuff you did! now that you're no longer at the old job! :)
23:56 JoeJulian   Huge difference.
23:56 pdurbin     everything you touch turns to gold
23:57 JoeJulian   There, I had planned it all, had ongoing plans. Here they put together a POC and sales started selling it.
23:57 pdurbin     sounds like gold to me
