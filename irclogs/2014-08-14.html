16:00 semiosis  in late september or november I'll have the opportunity to overhaul our 3 year old puppet infra.  anyone have an opinion on whether I should stick with puppet, upgrading to the current latest, or try an alternative?
19:19 * pdurbin hears crickets
19:20 pdurbin   semiosis: are you tempted by any other system?
19:21 pdurbin   I'm wondering about hipchat. any downsides? only 25,000 messages with the free version looks like, of searchable history. https://www.hipchat.com/pricing
19:38 Whoop     Slack ftw
19:38 Whoop     tho it also has a message limit
19:38 Whoop     but its cheap so *shrug*
19:48 * pdurbin looks at https://slack.com/pricing
19:50 Whoop     they do large discounts
19:51 Whoop     and still very reasonable compared to the value you get from decent comms imo
20:01 semiosis  pdurbin: yes, tempted
20:28 pdurbin   semiosis: which one?
20:30 semiosis  idk
20:32 semiosis  CM has come a looong way in the last 3 years
20:32 semiosis  more than just config mgmt, the whole cloud automation scene
20:33 semiosis  vagrant, packer, chef, ansible, salt, juju, virtualbox... the list goes on
20:41 pdurbin   as long as `vagrant up` works I'm happy. I don't care what's used to configure the box :)
21:01 semiosis  in other news, thinking about getting one of these for the office, to liven things up a bit: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vIJINiK9azc
21:21 larsks    semiosis: Hahahaha, I knew what the video was going to be before I clicked on it.
