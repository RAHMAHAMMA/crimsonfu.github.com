20:36 bene_   eat it or wear it!
20:40 pdurbin bene_: heh. seriously though, what's not to like about Gitter?
20:44 larsks  pdurbin: the fact that it's a ghost town? Or are people actually using it?  I only know about it because I spent a little time looking for "slack" alternatives...
21:11 pdurbin https://gitter.im/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4j isn't a ghost town
21:12 pdurbin larsks: unlike Slack, Gitter can be public, like a public mailing list for an open source project. There's transparency. You can read without joining.
21:12 larsks  pdurbin: right, but do you know any projects that are using it?
21:13 pdurbin besides the one I just linked to, I guess you mean
21:13 larsks  Oh, I missed that, totally....
21:13 pdurbin scala uses it: https://gitter.im/scala/scala
21:13 larsks  Neat.
21:14 pdurbin IPython uses it: https://gitter.im/ipython/ipython
21:15 pdurbin https://gitter.im/scikit-learn/scikit-learn
21:15 pdurbin https://gitter.im/pydata/pandas etc.
21:49 pdurbin What do folks think of my "if I were the boss" idea for github issues: https://github.com/waffleio/waffle.io/issues/126#issuecomment-149087524 ? :)
21:53 pdurbin "My Ranking" (or whatever)
