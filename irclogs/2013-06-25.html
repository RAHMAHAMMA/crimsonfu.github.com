15:55 codex anyone know of any good usb temp+humidity sensors
15:55 codex need it to work under linux
20:48 ben_e i bought a phidgets kit to monitor humidity in my basement a few years ago

20:49 ben_e but they are not an all-in-one solution
20:49 ben_e you have to write some python/perl/whatever to access and graph the temps
20:50 ben_e it's hobbyist grade and not necessarily something you would buy to put in your server room
