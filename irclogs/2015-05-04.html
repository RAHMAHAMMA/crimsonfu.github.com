13:50 skay       hey, any of you have some approachable python things that a new python programmer could work on productively? my usergroup has a mentorship program and one of the mentees doesn't have a project and is floundering
13:51 skay       pdurbin: is two ravens accessible for a new contributor?
13:51 skay       The two mentors emailed me to ask if I have suggestions. I emailed back to see if the mentor is familiar with django (she's a data scientist who uses python)
13:52 skay       and I asked hte student what kinds of hobbies she has (and pointed her to our rfid tracking system at the hackerspace)
13:53 skay       pdurbin: anyway, let me know if you have the people-infrastructure in place to onboard a potential contributor
14:30 semiosis   pdurbin: use terminal tabs instead of windows
14:30 semiosis   pdurbin: or really, use kubuntu.  the konsole app in kde is the *best* terminal app ever.
14:30 pdurbin    semiosis: this happens with firefox windows too. I never had these problems with gnome2
14:31 pdurbin    skay: yes! but TwoRavens is javascript (d3) not django
14:31 semiosis   pdurbin: kubuntu!
14:31 skay       pdurbin: derp
14:31 pdurbin    skay: we use all the languages here
14:31 skay       pdurbin: golang?
14:31 pdurbin    ok not all of them
14:32 pdurbin    semiosis: does kubuntu use gnome2?
14:32 semiosis   fsck no
14:32 semiosis   kde baby!
14:32 * skay     is watching ubunto online summit keynote with mark right now
14:32 * skay     is running gnome3 instead of unity
14:32 * semiosis hates gnome (and unity)
14:32 skay       ha
14:32 skay       was using wmii a while
14:33 pdurbin    skay: how's your alt-tab experience with gnome 3?
14:34 skay       pdurbin: I'm not good with switching between terminals. if you stay on a tab with the terminal, it will pop up options for all the terminals, but I don't know the key to use to cycle through those
14:34 skay       it does cycle through terminals and selects the other one than the last one it was on
14:34 pdurbin    skay: I mean using alt-tab to switch between apps, between firefox and terminal or whatever
14:34 skay       I think unity does that?
14:35 skay       pdurbin: yeah, when you do that, if you have the alt-tab thingee list, and remain on the terminal thing, it then shows another thingee list with a list of the terms
14:35 pdurbin    skay: you you see it too?!? alt-tab forgets which terminal window you're on? it drives me crazy!
14:35 semiosis   pdurbin: is there an option to group/not group windows of the same application?
14:36 skay       pdurbin: yeah. I usually only have two terminals windows, and then tmux inside of them
14:36 skay       so it doesn't drive me as crazy
14:36 pdurbin    semiosis: not sure. I'm just using the default setup. I'm new to ubuntu
14:36 skay       pdurbin: I can't remember all the options, but you may be able to do what semiosis suggests
14:36 semiosis   pdurbin: sudo apt-get install desktop-kde
14:36 * skay     wanders off to another channel
14:36 skay       pdurbin: switch to awesome
14:36 pdurbin    or ratpoison
14:36 skay       pdurbin: or i3, I can't remember
14:37 semiosis   it's easy to sidegrade between *buntus, then you can login to whichever desktop you want
14:37 pdurbin    maybe I'll just switch back to fedora. /cc mhayden larsks
15:26 pdurbin    skay: we do have django apps to hack on, if you're interested
15:27 skay       pdurbin: yeah. (it's the two ravens that stuck in my head as the cool thing.)
15:29 pdurbin    TwoRavens is hella cool
15:29 pdurbin    searchbot`: lucky tworavens iqss
15:29 searchbot` pdurbin: http://datascience.iq.harvard.edu/about-tworavens
15:29 skay       pdurbin: dangit, what was the django project called?
15:30 skay       dataverse.org right?
15:35 pdurbin    skay: yes, https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse.org is half Django and half Sphinx
15:36 pdurbin    skay: we list all the django apps in a google doc linked from https://github.com/IQSS/plaid
15:52 mhayden    pdurbin: did someone say fedora? ;)
16:36 mhayden    pdurbin: i'm lazy and i use GNOME 3 + Fedora 21
16:36 mhayden    but for tiling WM's, skay is right about i3 -- it's pretty nice
18:29 pdurbin    mhayden: do you use alt-tab much? does it forget which terminal window were using?
18:30 mhayden    i do use alt-tab pretty regularly
18:30 pdurbin    mhayden: no complaints?
18:30 mhayden    only problem i see is that urgent window hints are ignored
18:30 mhayden    for example, a terminal bell hits and i get no warning (other than the sound)
18:30 mhayden    and messages coming through pidgin don't really have a notification
18:31 mhayden    whereas older gnome or XFCE would pulsate the task button for that window
18:31 pdurbin    ok. I should probably switch back to fedora then
18:31 mhayden    i'm toying with an F22 beta upgrade this week
18:32 mhayden    just need to ensure that the additional repos i have already have F22 pkgs
18:34 melodie    hello
18:37 mhayden    ohai
