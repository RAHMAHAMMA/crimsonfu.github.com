02:07 codex     hydrajump: flynn will be great, but too complicated, not there yet. Primarily the "docker" setup is the well thought out part -- the dokku part was just for playing with it
02:07 codex     both were very easy to setup
02:08 hydrajump hey codex
02:09 hydrajump I'm now using weechat, but still a bit to go before I'm comfortable with it versus using textualapp.
02:10 codex     i still haven't played w/ weechat
02:11 hydrajump It's taken quite a bit of time to go through settings and just get a "basic" setup, but I like to know what the different settings are doing, so it's taken longer than it should
02:13 hydrajump I'll put my config on my github in a few days when I get a hang of it and I'll post a link. I've got it running on ec2, but when I find time I want to have it running probably on digital ocean as a docker container with others
02:15 hydrajump The reason I asked about how you are using docker + dokku is that I'm thinking about how I want to run various apps/ services on a cloud provider and using just a bunch of docker containers is one way, but then I read about dokku. Well there are so many services/ tools springing up around docker it's not easy to get a grasp on what's stable and worthwhile using.
02:23 bene      are people really running user apps in containers now?
02:24 bene      weechat in one and mutt in another?
02:47 pdurbin   hydrajump: huh, I pretty much only change five things from the default: http://wiki.greptilian.com/weechat
02:48 pdurbin   bene: good question
02:53 bene      https://twitter.com/nickstinemates/status/419255104147972096 <- mutt in a docker container
02:54 bene      i'm not sure i see the point
02:56 bene      https://index.docker.io/u/tianon/mutt-gmail/ <- more
03:01 pdurbin   good answer
03:13 bene      coffee, scotch or bed?
