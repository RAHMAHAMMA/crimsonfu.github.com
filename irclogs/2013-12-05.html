01:16 joshu_     semiosis yeah I read it a week or so ago on the security researchers twitter accountâ€¦scary and amazing at the same time
02:09 pdurbin    wat
02:10 pdurbin    semiosis and joshu_: please keep us posted on how the story ends. seems like we'll know more in a few weeks or months
17:45 evqqms     yo I need NX NoMachine 4.0 license
17:45 evqqms     like a cracked license
17:45 evqqms     idc where it comes frm
17:46 semiosis   is this a joke?
17:46 evqqms     why would it be a joke
17:46 semiosis   you've come to the wrong place, this is not a warez channel
17:46 evqqms     but I bet you have it
17:47 semiosis   take a hike
17:47 semiosis   we prefer free & open source software here
17:47 evqqms     why it's terrible
17:47 semiosis   lol ok
17:48 * semiosis gbtw, not feeding trolls
17:48 evqqms     fine ill find a nx license elsewhere
17:53 * pdurbin  shakes head
17:54 semiosis   from a harvard address!
17:54 semiosis   or spoofing somehow
17:54 pdurbin    very strange
17:55 semiosis   it's so over the top i thought maybe it was a friend of yours playing a joke
20:13 dotplus    HumanSky! apparently freenode is a small place
20:27 pdurbin    found him in #openscholar
20:35 semiosis   writing java code is a lot like writing an essay.  writing puppet code seems closer to cooking than writing.
20:36 dotplus    and writing perl?
20:37 * dotplus  runs
20:37 semiosis   poetry, of course
20:43 * pdurbin  hugs perl
