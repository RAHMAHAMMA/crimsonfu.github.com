12:08 SEJeff       pdurbin, Are you asking the xfs question in gest or seriously?
12:32 pdurbin      SEJeff: dead serious. but maybe it's an iSCSI or network problem. i haven't found the root cause of the failure yet
12:33 pdurbin      i haven't really looked, though. busy weekend
12:34 pdurbin      i was just thinking about where i want to squirrel away logs and such.  should i make the RT ticket bloated by attaching logs? should i save the log somewhere on our nfs server. should i throw them in a git repo?  i often default to git these days
12:42 SEJeff       pdurbin, from my professional experience...
12:42 SEJeff       xfs lacks a lot of limitations of ext3
12:43 SEJeff       such as the 32k files per directory limit
12:43 SEJeff       xfs is also extremely fast, however, xfs is very very poor at fault tolerance
12:44 SEJeff       Meaning if you are writing to xfs and you pull the plug on the server, the filesystem has a high chance of corruption. Often repairable with fsck, but I am always wary of xfs as it has bitten me several times
12:44 SEJeff       We used to use xfs on our Fusion IO cards
12:44 SEJeff       never more
12:47 SEJeff       And in general don't ever use xfs on our large volumes
13:02 pdurbin      but "xfs is for lots or large"
13:04 pdurbin      "If you have large or lots, use XFS" -- Val Aurora, LCA 2007 - page 2 of XFS: Adventures in Metadata Scalability http://xfs.org/index.php/Image:Xfs-scalability-lca2012.pdf

13:26 shuff        interesting!  i wonder why

13:28 pdurbin      shuff: can you just type for me exactly what you're typing?
13:28 shuff        '/msg crimsonfubot google irc commands'
13:31 pdurbin      huh. i have no idea why the output doesn't stay in the channel for me. i'm using irssi, if it matters

13:46 pdurbin      anyone else going?
13:47 shuff        hmmm
13:47 shuff        i should see about that; i would like to go
13:48 shuff        now that i am working in an environment with RHDS, i would like a bit more information about RHDS vs. RHIPA
13:51 pdurbin      are you thinking about switching to RHIPA?
13:51 shuff        i am thinking that i don't know enough to evaluate the options
13:52 pdurbin      ok :)

14:51 magoo        hoping someone can help shed some light on my provisioning weirdness this morning. One of our devs and myself went to rebuild our environment in vagrant and every debian package that is to be installed will fail with Hash Sum mismatch.
14:55 magoo        this wasn't the case last week. Here's where it gets weird though: I can log onto the box and run apt-get update and then start the provisioning back up and it will move past the last package that didn't work but then fail on another package with the same error. Then I repeat the process all over to move past that one.
15:00 pdurbin      magoo: i assume you don't have these problems with a vanilla vagrant debian/ubuntu base box
15:04 magoo        pdurbin: yeah, it's only after chef starts running
15:04 pdurbin      kiss the cook. blame the chef
15:05 magoo        The odd thing is that I don't generally specify package versions in my cookbooks and the version is automatically added like so apt-get -q -y install couchdb=0.10.0-1ubuntu2
15:06 magoo        if i pull off the version and do it manually, it's fine
15:06 magoo        or I can run apt-get update and rerun the provisioning and it'll also work
15:06 magoo        I'll go harrass the #chef guys now
15:11 pdurbin      :) ok
15:11 pdurbin      reading about xfs write caches: http://xfs.org/index.php/XFS_FAQ#Q%3a_What_is_the_problem_with_the_write_cache_on_journaled_filesystems.3F
15:44 magoo        agoddard: you mind provisiong your vagrant chef box and seeing if you get similar results to above?
15:46 magoo        i based my chef vm on street-chef so I imagine you will also run into these errors
15:58 SEJeff       shuff, RHDS is a subset of RHIPA
15:58 SEJeff       RHDS == the 389 directory server
15:58 SEJeff       RHIPA == the 389 directory server with freeipa ontop. I have a good amount of experience with that team
15:58 SEJeff       if you have any questions I might be able to help. fwiw, our company has the earliest big deployment of sssd... long before it was 1.0 and I was lead on that project
15:59 SEJeff       maybe 2 or 3 years ago
16:01 SEJeff       Both are derived from the netscape directory server codebase that redhat bought for 14 mill or so and subsequently open sauced
16:05 magoo        agoddard: n/m, Ubuntu repos are having issues right now and they are aware of it
