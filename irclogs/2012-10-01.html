13:42 shuff        WRITTEN IN AWK
13:47 pdurbin      shuff: do i want it?
13:51 shuff        i cannot imagine that you do
14:10 Itkovian     pdurbin: wrt to the autovivivivivivivfication, did not have any time to program this weekend, next weekend is not looking good either :-p
15:04 pdurbin      Itkovian: take your time. looking forward to it :)
15:05 Itkovian     just to make it clear, the idea is that all intermediate structures are created in some way, right? for all of the final JSON astructures you wish to derive
15:05 pdurbin      yeah, ideally
15:06 pdurbin      agoddard: you were lazy about this, if i recall...
15:06 Itkovian     hmmz
15:06 Itkovian     :-p
16:50 pdurbin_m    yeah. data3 laziness: https://github.com/crimsonfu/code/blob/60d23d8df6983ffc0d782a8dfa9d488b0d548333/katas/autovivification/agoddard.rb
17:41 agoddard     pdurbin: yep!
17:46 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky laziness is a virture
17:46 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Wall
17:46 pdurbin      heh
17:46 pdurbin      Itkovian: but not in this case
17:53 pdurbin      hmm. looks like a decent sssd writeup: http://www.couyon.net/1/post/2012/04/enabling-ldap-usergroup-support-and-authentication-in-centos-6.html

19:08 JoeJulian    Ok, has nothing to do with system administration other than this one got to ride in this a few times this weekend: https://plus.google.com/u/0/photos/113457525690313682370/albums/5793758227161596833/5793758230395793042

20:46 semiosis     i found this over the weekend and thought it was pretty cool... http://todomvc.com/
20:46 semiosis     they have a trivial todo list implemented using the major javascript frameworks
23:38 jimi_c       I just discovered bootstrap.js through using kibana - i love it
23:39 jimi_c       angular.js is pretty cool too
23:39 * jimi_c     fights urge to completely redo cobbler web...
23:39 jimi_c       again...
23:45 * semiosis   is reading the twitter bootstrap (bootstrap.js?) docs now
23:50 jimi_c       yeah that's it
23:57 semiosis     jimi_c: maybe you can help me understand this... but bootstrap seems totally concerned with ui/views, what about models &amp; controllers?
23:58 semiosis     say for example pulling in a list of thumbs/captions from a gallery json/rest api...
23:58 jimi_c       yes, it's very much a UI-centric helper, so you really need to couple it with something else like angular.js
23:58 semiosis     ah ha!
23:58 semiosis     thx
