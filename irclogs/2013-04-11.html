14:21 pdurbin      larsks: just wondering if you're still using weechat. I fired it up today and started taking some notes: http://wiki.greptilian.com/weechat
14:22 larsks       Nah, skipped back to irssi after a week or so because I didn't like the way weechat handled a lot of things (like hilight strings, for example).
14:23 pdurbin      ah. ok. oh well

20:57 pdurbin      is there such a thing as hosted ganglia? or similar? graphing of performance? for public urls, just load time on a home page?
