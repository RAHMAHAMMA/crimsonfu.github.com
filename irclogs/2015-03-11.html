00:18 prologic  dunno
00:18 prologic  I've not seen any major uses of it yet
00:18 prologic  and I haven' tried it yet either
00:19 pdurbin   time will tell I guess
00:19 * pdurbin wonders if he can join that slack channel via irc
01:41 bene      i wouldn't
01:41 bene      the tool was designed to be used a certain way
01:41 bene      i would first try the way the designers suggest
01:52 * pdurbin just joined
01:52 pdurbin   I'm looking at https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201314026-Understanding-roles-permissions-inside-Slack
01:53 pdurbin   what Slack calls a public channel I wouldn't call a public channel
01:53 pdurbin   #crimsonfu is a public channel
01:53 pdurbin   hell, it's even publicly logged
01:55 pdurbin   bene: I guess I'm trying to avoid yet another inbox
02:14 pdurbin   I'm sure Slack has its uses but I dunno, I'm more into public stuff right now: http://blog.codinghorror.com/maximizing-the-value-of-your-keystrokes/
02:19 prologic  you can totally join slack channels over irc
02:19 prologic  it's just a bit limited obviously
02:19 prologic  some of their fancier features don't work in IRC d'uh
02:19 prologic  but it works great nonetheless
02:20 prologic  they actually fully support Jabber/XMPP and IRC gateways
02:21 pdurbin   I deactivated my Slack account already.
02:21 pdurbin   my wife uses it at work, says it cuts down on email
02:23 pdurbin   if people at work want to try it that's fine with me. I'll join. It looks like accounts are per-organization anyway: https://slack.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201405046-Joining-multiple-Slack-teams
02:42 prologic  yeah
02:45 prologic  it *can* cut down on email
02:45 prologic  but in reality I don't htink it does
02:45 prologic  also otoh I'm not really a big fan of textual chat in organizations wher eyou can actually interact fact-to-face
02:45 prologic  because you loose a lot of the social interactions and often things can be said in ways that are misinterpreted in textual form
10:41 pdurbin   prologic: yeah but often even when you *can* interact face-to-face lots and lots of emails are sent out.
14:12 mhayden   pdurbin: doing red hat summit this summer?
14:56 pdurbin   wasn't planning on it
23:51 pdurbin   mhayden: you going?
23:51 pdurbin   it's funny, I'd probably benefit from the jboss stuff
23:52 pdurbin   I mean, it's all good stuff but the main app I work on is a Java EE app.
