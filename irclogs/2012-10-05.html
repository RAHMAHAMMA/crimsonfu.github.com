13:05 pdurbin      hmm, i wonder how easily i can install python 2.7.3 on centos 6
13:11 pdurbin      On linux SUSE or RedHat, how do I load Python 2.7 - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4149361/on-linux-suse-or-redhat-how-do-i-load-python-2-7
13:11 pdurbin      "make install will damage the system Python. Use make altinstall instead." :)
13:31 Itkovian     or use EasyBuild :-D
13:43 pdurbin      Itkovian: yeah? i was thinking of easybuild more for the whole cluster. for use with "modules"
13:43 Itkovian     surem but you can just install a single software package such as python as well
13:43 Itkovian     just clone and try on your local system
13:44 Itkovian     it's not going to install stuff where it overwrites other stuff
13:49 * pdurbin    joins #easybuild
13:50 pdurbin      looks like there's a quick start: http://hpcugent.github.com/easybuild/
