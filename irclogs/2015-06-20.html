00:22 prologic  pdurbin, should be fine :)
00:22 prologic  Heroku is just as good as any other PaaaS :)
00:23 pdurbin   prologic: trouble is, I've never used Heroku. I have played with OpenShift at least
00:28 prologic  alternatively use Digital Ocean + Docker + autodock
00:29 pdurbin   that sounds like maybe too much fuss
00:30 pdurbin   it's funny how it all comes down to familiarity
00:30 pdurbin   that's Rich Hickey point with simple vs easy
00:30 pdurbin   's
00:36 pdurbin   I hear Heroku is expensive. I wonder if it's worth it.
01:35 pdurbin   bene: are you up for geeking out at all this weekend? gonna try to meet up with mhayden if we can so we can trade more stories about westmaas ;) /cc ironcamel
01:37 bene      i'm camping this weekend
01:37 bene      and convening with some other geeks on sunday night i think
04:35 prologic  pdurbin, would you like me to show you how easy my alternative approach really is?
04:35 prologic  I'll demo it off live :)
11:14 pdurbin   prologic: that might be useful. however, I should probably better explain what I mean by easy. some of this comes down to dev vs ops and who is resposible for what. I'm kind of assuming your approach means that dev (you) is responsible for everything, that you are also ops, basically
11:19 prologic  this is true in general; yes
11:19 prologic  but the solutions I build can also be used by just ops quite easily
11:19 prologic  albeit I generally don't provide webuis or guis
11:19 prologic  just simple interfaces and tools
11:20 prologic  If you've read my blog post before: http://shortcircuit.net.au/~prologic/blog/article/2015/03/24/a-docker-based-mini-paas/
11:20 prologic  it's really as simple as copying that docker-compose.yml snippet
11:20 prologic  and running docker-compose up -d
11:21 prologic  the next thing I'm building (not yet published/released) is a tool to help orchestrate docker machines and services/containers
11:21 prologic  that uses both docker-machine and docker-compose together in a single declarative way
11:29 pdurbin   prologic: I'd be curious to hear what tasks would be the responsibility of dev vs ops
11:31 prologic  well I believe the two should be as simple as easy other I think
11:31 prologic  I'm a developer but I do operating as well and vice versa
11:31 prologic  I've been (so far in my career) as much of a developer as a sysadmin/networkadmin/operations person
11:32 pdurbin   prologic: you're saying you want both roles to be easy. dev and ops. sure. sounds good. but the roles are different
11:32 pdurbin   who does what?
11:33 pdurbin   in your docker model?
11:34 prologic  https://github.com/jimmyshen/sunset
11:34 prologic  this is really cool
11:34 prologic  ahh that's true I guess
11:34 prologic  but I guess what I'm really saying is that to be a good developer you have to be a good operations person and vice versa
11:35 prologic  I think the old model of developers develop software
11:35 pdurbin   oh absolutely. that's what this channel is about!
11:35 prologic  then palm it off to another team to deploy
11:35 prologic  is broken
11:35 pdurbin   "ops problem now"
11:35 prologic  exactly
11:35 prologic  it's that kind of mentality that has caused a lot of poorly written software
11:35 prologic  and poorly deployed systems
11:35 pdurbin   yep, yep
11:35 prologic  software and deployment *should* be living breathing systems
11:36 prologic  hence the dev+ops culture I think
11:36 pdurbin   yep
11:36 prologic  so think there is no distinct lines so to speak
11:36 prologic  the lines are very much blurred
11:36 pdurbin   well
11:36 pdurbin   the other day I started making a list
11:36 prologic  http://aroberge.blogspot.com.au/2015/06/generating-mazes.html
11:36 prologic  this is also a nice read
11:37 pdurbin   trying to think through if dev or ops is *primarily* responsible for things on my list
11:38 pdurbin   someone (or some team) has to own each responsibilty (primarily at least). it shouldn't be squishy
11:38 prologic  well yeah
11:38 prologic  yeah I dunno
11:38 pdurbin   dev and ops shouldn't be fighting about "I thought you were responsible for that"
11:38 prologic  I'm in two minds about that
11:38 prologic  on one hand it's hard to let go of the "red tape"
11:38 pdurbin   there should be clarity
11:38 prologic  and to try to keep the lines separate
11:38 prologic  on the other IHMO I think it's better tthat all are responsible
11:39 prologic  I think a lot of this can be solved with good/better communications?
11:39 prologic  rather than strict bureaucratic processes?
11:39 prologic  think about the ways in which many open source software projects and systems develop, thrive and continue to grow
11:40 prologic  often with crazy limitations to resources and man power
11:40 prologic  :)
11:40 pdurbin   I'm not talking about bureacracy. I'm just talking about a list of responsibilities that has dev or ops next to each bullet point
11:40 prologic  ahh k
11:40 prologic  but this kind of thinking assumes a difference between a person that can be in a dev role or ops role?
11:41 prologic  or have I misunderstood that?
11:42 pdurbin   I'm almost embarrassed to share the list because it's pretty old school. not very devopsy :)
11:42 pdurbin   maybe I could clean it up and throw it in a google doc or something
11:42 pdurbin   and allow comments
11:43 prologic  github it
11:43 prologic  inline core-review style commenting
11:43 pdurbin   heh. I guess I could stick it somewhere under https://github.com/crimsonfu/crimsonfu.github.com
11:45 pdurbin   maybe a branch would be best
11:45 prologic  *nods*
11:47 mhayden   pdurbin: i could do some geeking
11:48 pdurbin   mhayden: I was looking at the weather. too bad it looks a bit rainy sunday night. I was thinking I could bike over to hynes, give you a hubway fob, and then bike over to grendels
11:48 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky boston hubway
11:48 searchbot pdurbin: http://www.thehubway.com/
11:49 pdurbin   prologic: so maybe the branch will contain a future blog post by me
11:49 mhayden   i thought "hubway fob" was something i needed to look up on urban dictionary
11:49 pdurbin   once it's been peer reviewed :)
11:50 pdurbin   mhayden: heh. there's also a bus that goes right down mass ave (#1) or the T
11:51 mhayden   gotcha
11:52 prologic  pdurbin, sounds good :)
11:53 pdurbin   mhayden: so if we're going to grendels sunday night we should ping codex
11:55 mhayden   okay, there's a dev nation shindig that night
11:55 mhayden   not sure on timing
11:56 pdurbin   can anyone go to dev nation?
12:10 pdurbin   mhayden: I'd go to anything with "dev" in it :)
12:13 mhayden   i think registration shot up to 750 for 2 days :|
12:16 pdurbin   yikes!
12:16 pdurbin   what am I made of money
12:20 mhayden   hah
12:20 mhayden   it was ~ 200 before
12:20 pdurbin   mhayden: I've been cleared for whatever. lunch, coffee. I can come to hynes. we'll bring the party to you if you want :)
12:21 pdurbin   (might be a party of 2)
12:41 mhayden   okay,will let you know when i get there
12:41 mhayden   boarding now
12:59 pdurbin   safe flight!
13:00 pdurbin   I could use some help with naming a project: http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2015-06-20#i_121593
13:57 pdurbin   is there a free online tool that lets people suggest names and everyone gets to vote?
14:03 pdurbin   or maybe it would be called a polling tool
14:07 hydrajump pdurbin: http://strawpoll.me/
14:13 pdurbin   hydrajump: yeah? you like that one? never heard of it
14:13 pdurbin   is anyone able to create a card here? https://trello.com/b/9oNykDM3/addressbookmvc-rename
14:19 pdurbin   hydrajump: strawpoll doesn't seem to allow the public to add suggestions to the poll
14:28 pdurbin   maybe http://shapado.com would work
15:04 hydrajump pdurbin: I've never used strawpoll just something I've come across and made a note.
17:26 codex     pdurbin: cant' this sunday, but i'll definitely join you some week
17:26 codex     next few weeks are out -- still dealing with selling a house, etc.
18:45 pdurbin   my wife wants to buy a bigger place

21:50 melodie   pdurbin http://www.forumchangerdere.fr/
21:56 pdurbin   oh, a real forum :)
