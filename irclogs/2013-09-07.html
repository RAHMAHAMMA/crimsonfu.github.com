22:09 * melodie looks at what the cape is
22:09 melodie   nice beach pdurbin is that the cape ?
22:22 pdurbin   melodie: for me there's only one cape: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cape_Cod
22:23 melodie   pdurbin one more word for my vocabulary!
22:24 melodie   cape in French is "cap" and we pronounce it 'kap'
22:26 melodie   but a French cape is sort of a long coat without sleeves :D
23:04 pdurbin   a cape is what Superman wears :)
23:04 melodie   yes
23:04 melodie   so a cape on someone and a cape diving into the ocean is the same word in English?
23:09 pdurbin   yep. they're homonyms
23:10 pdurbin   semiosis: you wouldn't like all this EC2 bashing: http://realtalk.io/2013/6/10/episode-6.html ... and I can't say I agree with all of it either
23:16 melodie   pdurbin if you have a few minutes free there is something which I would like to talk about with you, a project I have started with a few buddies here on the chans
