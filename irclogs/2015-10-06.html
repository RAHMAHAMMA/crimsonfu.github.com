14:38 pdurbin   bene: I'm checking out http://www.slideshare.net/datascienceiqss/sliz-2015-dataverse-sb-griddb
14:48 bene      62 datasets?
14:49 pdurbin   bene: where are you seeing that?
14:49 bene      couting the datasets/beamline graph
14:50 pdurbin   ah. I was wondering what a beamline is
14:50 * pdurbin looks at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamline
14:51 bene      https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beamline#Synchrotron_radiation_beamline
14:51 pdurbin   ah, thanks
14:52 bene      https://store.synchrotron.org.au/stats/ <- the australian synchrotron has been archiving datasets for several years at least
14:53 bene      but most of those are not public
14:53 bene      https://github.com/mytardis/mytardis <- open source software hosting it
14:53 pdurbin   nice. Data stored (at least): 77.0 TB
14:54 bene      the US synchrotrons have made some runs at similar projects
14:54 bene      i'm not sure how far they have gotten
14:56 pdurbin   it's all pretty new to me. interesting though
14:56 bene      we had kicked around the sbgrid data bank idea several times over the years
15:00 pdurbin   seems like it already exists: SBGrid Data Bank - https://data.sbgrid.org
15:01 pdurbin   119 datasets
15:02 bene      yeah, they built it this year i think
15:05 bene      interesting
15:05 bene      it's restricted to sbgrid PIs
15:05 pdurbin   ah. yep. 'A username and password are being requested by https://data.sbgrid.org. The site says: "Dataset depositions are open only to members of the SBGrid Community. To request access to the deposition page, please contact data@sbgrid.org."'
