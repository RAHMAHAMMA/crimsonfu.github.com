22:52 TrueDD    hi, everyone
22:56 * pdurbin looks at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2013-11-25#i_7914558
22:57 pdurbin   TrueDD: you need to learn something about Ruby?
23:00 TrueDD    pdurbin, I'll have to learn Ruby, from the start, and Rails also, cause it's the framwork I'll have to work on
23:00 TrueDD    framework*
23:09 pdurbin   TrueDD: sounds like you plan to learn Ruby first, which makes sense
23:13 TrueDD    Rails looks great and really useful to gain time, but I'd like to go deeper and learn what exactly hides beneath
23:14 TrueDD    I always told myself that the best way to master something is to understand what it is built on
23:15 pdurbin   TrueDD: what version of Rails?
23:16 TrueDD    as we're gonna start a somewhat new project, I was thinking about using its last release
23:20 TrueDD    actually, we intend to rebuild our application that already runs for ages now and that has been made from little pieces of code here and there, and that brings almost as much problems than solutions
23:40 pdurbin   sounds like a fun project
23:41 TrueDD    the former application was made by my co-worker and he masters all that pretty much
23:42 TrueDD    and I'm a total beginner in that language and its framework
23:44 TrueDD    I could make some tests though, and I really like it
23:44 TrueDD    it really seems great!
23:51 pdurbin   TrueDD: total beginner in the old framework? what's the old framework?
23:52 TrueDD    I said "in that language and its framework"
23:53 TrueDD    where did you see "old"? :)
23:53 semiosis  [18:41] <TrueDD> the former application was made by my co-worker and he masters all that pretty much
23:53 semiosis  s/former/old/
23:53 semiosis  afaict
23:53 TrueDD    oh, right!
23:54 TrueDD    I'm a total beginner in both the former duet of tools and the news versions of that very duet of tools :)
23:55 TrueDD    he always tried to keep the set up to date
23:55 TrueDD    so for him, it's not gonna be a big jump
23:58 TrueDD    I don't think that it's gonna be that difficult for me either, besides, the hardest thing in my opinion will be to get rid of the "bad habits" I caught with Perl, for example.
