12:33 ben_e     interesting
12:33 ben_e     whuggle is a general term of affection used in a few irc channels i'm in
12:33 ben_e     i figured urban dictionary would have it
12:33 ben_e     but nyet
12:34 pdurbin   plop
12:34 ben_e     it's like a wuving huggle
12:34 * ben_e   whuggles pdurbin
12:34 ben_e     are you going to abcd today?
12:35 pdurbin   hmm..  SPECIAL PRESENTATION: Chris Erdmann
12:35 pdurbin   I prolly should...
12:35 pdurbin   ben_e: what's he talking about?
12:36 pdurbin   oh. I found it
12:36 ben_e     tech at the SAO?
12:37 ben_e     Christopher Erdmann, Head Librarian for the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, will be giving a talk on the precise degree of shame other scientific librarians feel when trying to compete with that title.
12:41 * pdurbin emails him, asking if the talk will be awesome
12:42 ben_e     do you know him?
12:42 pdurbin   oh sure, he's involved with http://theastrodata.org :)
12:43 ben_e     right, right
12:43 joshu     afternoon
12:44 ben_e     and morning!
12:45 joshu     quick silly question. i need to generate a new password for a specific very annoying user who prefers using her name as her pass. I know it's not the best but I'm considering using the 1password generator and giving her a pass like this: neb-ob-fa-qu and she's just going to have to learn it. Any thoughts? I know i know users
12:47 pdurbin   joshu: do the right thing
12:50 joshu     pdurbin which is? give her a head slap :P
17:42 * pdurbin puts semiosis's name in quotes: https://redmine.hmdc.harvard.edu/issues/3208#note-1 :)
19:33 codex     Hi, one of my co-workers launched his game as a kickstarter: http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/2038969690/roll-call-is-fun-fast
19:33 codex     please consider buying a set or two
19:34 codex     i'ts a wicked fun game to play in almost any social setting (especially in bars and such)
19:34 codex     it's very simple to learn, and fun for a long time
20:24 ben_e     pdurbin: marlena says you have been trying to recruit her for irc
20:35 pdurbin   ben_e: she participated here: http://irclog.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/2013-02-13#i_809 :)
20:41 ben_e     i broached the abcd irc server idea with rei and a few others that were around
20:41 ben_e     it basically comes down to me being willing to run it probably
20:42 ben_e     i guess i should stand up irc.abcd.harvard.edu at some point
20:44 larsks    ben_e: what would be the point of a local irc server?  why not just have #harvard_abcd here on freenode?
20:45 ben_e     i think the big win would be reliability
20:45 ben_e     no netsplits due to DDOS of freenode
20:45 larsks    ...really?  Because I've found freenode to be pretty reliable, and running a single server here seems like a good SPOF.
20:45 ben_e     some local-to-harvard admins if we get some bad actors
20:46 ben_e     i also think the officially unofficial blessing of an ABCD server would entice more people to join
20:46 larsks    And it would be part of freenode?  Or some other net?
20:46 ben_e     i was thinking just a standalone server
20:47 ben_e     i understand the SPOF aspect, but i had it in mind as a low key, informal networking thing for tech ppl at harvard
20:48 ben_e     if they are going to use it to coordinate during HU network outages then...
20:48 ben_e     more thinking/engineering/etc would be required
20:48 larsks    I dunno.  All the freenode services (cert. based authentication, chanserv, etc) are nice.  And not having to be logged into multiple servers is nice, too.
20:48 larsks    And the community is nice!
20:48 ben_e     that is a win
20:48 ben_e     i suspect that the people we might attract to an abcd server would not be the types who joined and used public irc anyway
20:49 larsks    I would vote for creating harvard-oriented channels here on freenode.  I would probably ignore a local server that wasn't part of a larger network.
20:49 ben_e     noted :-)
20:49 larsks    ...but that's moot, because I'm leaving in a month anyway.
20:49 * ben_e   scratches out the note
20:49 ben_e     congrats?
20:50 ben_e     where are you off to?
20:50 larsks    Heading to Red Hat! Starting early September.
20:50 ben_e     has AC been assimilated yet?
20:50 ben_e     you got poached by mamiller!
20:50 larsks    Something like. :)
20:50 ben_e     are you joining him in fedora cloud community ops thingy?
20:51 ben_e     or another group?
20:51 larsks    I'm going to be joining their openstack/cloud group.
20:51 ben_e     cool
20:51 ben_e     how many people left in AC when you go?
20:51 larsks    1 full time and 2 part time.
20:52 ben_e     and no replacement for rob yet?
20:52 larsks    They have hired a new Assistant Dean for Computing, starts on 8/19.  Not a replacement for Rob; the position is at a higher level.
20:52 ben_e     the possibility of HUIT assimilation looms over every small IT group i think
20:52 ben_e     nods
21:52 semiosis  why do i keep making changes to prod after 5 PM on fridays?!?!?!
21:52 semiosis  need a poster on the wall to remind me not to do this
22:43 ben_e     you should just start drinking at 4 PM
23:32 pdurbin   larsks: congrats! don't forget us!
23:32 pdurbin   and I agree that freenode is both awesome and reliable
