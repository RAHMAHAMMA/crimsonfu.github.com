18:29 pdurbin puppet fun... Bug #4409: puppetmasterd does not find custom types for environment - Puppet - Puppet Labs - http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/4409
18:29 pdurbin Bug #12173: Masters cannot reliably distinguish between multiple versions of a type/function/plugin used in different environments - Puppet - Puppet Labs - http://projects.puppetlabs.com/issues/12173
18:30 pdurbin "its one of the nastier issues with puppet" -- http://irclog.perlgeek.de/puppet-openstack/2012-11-15#i_6157367
18:31 pdurbin 'A secondary problem is that the location where the master looks for the definition of native types is not the same as the location of plug-in files that the master distributes to agents. This leads to confusion even for people who are not using a “test” environment, because it means that they have to put their type definitions in two places, one where they can be picked up by the master and one where they can be sent as plug-ins to agents.'
