13:29 pdurbin      raprasad: welcome!
13:29 raprasad     thanks!
13:32 pdurbin      raprasad: some django chatter in here... http://irclog.perlgeek.de/search.pl?channel=crimsonfu&amp;nick=&amp;q=django
13:34 raprasad_    I see the tasty pie references:)
13:34 pdurbin      i haven't had much time to play with it... but it seems awesome
13:36 pdurbin      cool, this still works: http://server1.greptilian.com:8000/api/poll/?format=json
13:37 raprasad     somehow this django app has been running since 2006 (3 sql tables), in much need of features/etc
13:37 raprasad     http://www.newhavencrimelog.org/
13:42 raprasad     from non-sys-admin:  Are these instructions valid for installing an SSL cert on a unix.fas VM?
13:42 raprasad     http://www.tc.umn.edu/~brams006/selfsign_ubuntu.html/
13:42 raprasad     the VM is Ubuntu 10.04.4 LTS
13:47 pdurbin      raprasad: that doc looks reasonable
13:47 raprasad     thanks
14:42 pdurbin      making noise on the dell linux poweredge list... Monitoring hardware RAID: LSI SAS 2008 controller, OMSA - http://lists.us.dell.com/pipermail/linux-poweredge/2012-July/046801.html
14:54 pdurbin      "I just updated to Mountain Lion on my Mac and now I'm having trouble..." [DELETE]
14:54 pdurbin      just kidding!
15:26 agoddard     pdurbin: what shared filesystem were you using for OS recently? (at least.. I think you were using one? :/)
15:53 pdurbin      agoddard: are you talking about gluster?
15:55 agoddard     pdurbin: I said OS but I meant KVM :) for VM storage
15:56 pdurbin      our kvm disk images are on an EMC, shared up over NFS
15:56 pdurbin      4 storage pools like this
15:56 pdurbin      we're thinking of adding a 5th storage pool backed by gluster, for testing
15:57 agoddard     awsiq
15:58 pdurbin      JoeJulian is using gluster with kvm: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-06-30#i_5771081
15:59 agoddard     I'm thinking about testing GFS2 or something on an iSCSI LUN for KVM
16:00 pdurbin      we're basically dismantling the GFS2 setup we had
16:05 agoddard     no good?
16:05 pdurbin      if we're going to use iSCSI, i think we want oVirt to manage all the iSCSI stuff
16:06 pdurbin      agoddard: GFS2 was before my time
16:06 pdurbin      don't let me dissuade you :)
16:10 agoddard     will let you know how I go :)
16:15 pdurbin      agoddard: curious if you've looked at crowbar - "Crowbar is a platform for server provisioning and deployment from bare metal. It provides server discovery, firmware upgrades, and operating system installation using PXE Boot. It deploys applications on top of functioning operating systems using chef." -- Home · dellcloudedge/crowbar Wiki - https://github.com/dellcloudedge/crowbar/wiki/
16:16 pdurbin      was reminded or crowbar because i was wondering if dell users hang out on irc. i guess the crowbar people use freenode and skype
17:12 JoeJulian    Indeed, I am using gluster with kvm. I have been for more than a year, managed by puppet using libvirt. Just got OpenStack working, too, yesterday.
17:14 Pax          mountain lion upgrade… so far so good :)
17:16 pdurbin      JoeJulian: nice! openstack has taken a back seat to monitoring for now
17:20 pdurbin      i told the gluster guys i met at the red hat summit that i'd see them in #gluster. but i haven't been hanging out there. busy busy
18:46 PaxIndustria ok, I have to say, mosh, pretty cool
18:46 PaxIndustria I have it in dev, and I jumped IP's and it popped me right back online
19:06 pdurbin      cool
19:06 pdurbin      perl -MData::Dumper -e 'sub A{map{@_&gt;1?[A(@_)]:@_}1..shift};print Dumper A(3,4,5,"foo")'
19:08 ironcamel    pdurbin: what are you trying to do?
19:09 pdurbin      make a buddy's subroutine dump out something
19:09 pdurbin      he's a perl golfer
19:14 ironcamel    is the output correct?
19:15 pdurbin      yep. yields 3x4x5 foo's :)
19:21 ironcamel    not for me
19:22 ironcamel    oh, you mean 3 4x5 foos
19:22 ironcamel    yeah, it does
19:23 ironcamel    pretty clever
19:28 pdurbin      :)
