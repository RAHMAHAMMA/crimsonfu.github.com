02:11 pdurbin     magoo: nice link. better than https://help.ubuntu.com/community/SwitchingToUbuntu/FromLinux/RedHatEnterpriseLinuxAndFedora
02:15 pdurbin     i like this "Specific technology readiness for use in distributed systems" at http://www.bluebox.net/news/2012/04/distributed-systems-design-part-44/ . mysql, postgres, memcache, apache, nginx, passenger, unicorn, derby, ha-nfs, cdns, reeds, hadoop, risk, mongo, rails
12:59 magoo       pdurbin: great links! really like the last one
13:01 pdurbin     reeds? i meant redis :)
13:02 SEJeff      pdurbin, Agreed! /me adds all 4 to his reading list for this evening: http://www.bluebox.net/news/category/distributed-systems
13:02 pdurbin     i really need to get that mojo client working, so i can just grab all the h2 tags off a page or whatever
13:03 SEJeff      Can't you do that with lwp?
13:03 SEJeff      since you're a perl fan :)
13:04 pdurbin     oh, probably. but i watched a mojolicious screencast and it looked like the work was already done for me
13:04 * pdurbin   googles
13:13 pdurbin     here. `mojo get http://mojolicio.us 'h1, h2, h3' text` from http://search.cpan.org/~sri/Mojolicious-2.93/lib/Mojolicious/Guides/Cookbook.pod#Command_line
13:14 SEJeff      Oh *that* is cool
13:14 pdurbin     i'm pretty sure this is the corresponding screencast: Mojolicious Mojocast #5: Mojo::UserAgent - http://mojocasts.com/e5
13:14 SEJeff      I was completely ignorant of people really doing this sort of thing with perl. It makes me happy someone is.
13:17 pdurbin     see also "show me mice!" at. . . And Perl Happens :3 - http://cat.eatsmou.se
13:32 * pdurbin   runs perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'CPAN::install(Mojolicious)'
13:34 pdurbin     mojo get http://www.bluebox.net/news/2012/04/distributed-systems-design-part-44/ 'h2' text | tr "\n" " "
13:34 pdurbin     MySQL PostgreSQL Memcache Apache / Nginx / Passenger / Unicorn DRBD / HA-NFS CDNs and other caching technologies Redis Hadoop, Riak, and other “eventually consistent” cloud technologies Mongo Rails
13:34 pdurbin     that's better. and way less prone to human error
13:35 pdurbin     redis is even spelled right :)
13:42 SEJeff      Anyone ever used meteor.js + any of the perl stuff with it?
13:43 SEJeff      A coworker was tinkering with it showing me how he would edit html on the server and it updates on the clients in realtime
13:52 pdurbin     "we built our own. A perl-based HTTP server written from the ground up to support high concurrency and longevity of connections" -- http://meteorserver.org . interesting
14:00 SEJeff      pdurbin, Also see: http://meteor.com/ Take a look at the page source. They certainly do seem to dogfood
14:03 pdurbin     SEJeff: http://meteor.com doesn't work in elinks. :)
14:04 SEJeff      Ha unsurprising
14:51 pdurbin     shuff: "Farewell Icinga API
14:52 pdurbin     https://www.icinga.org/2011/08/05/farewell-icinga-api/ via http://tweetree.com/posts/199857428144197632
14:52 SEJeff      wha!?
14:53 pdurbin     SEJeff: i haven't really had time to absorb it
14:53 SEJeff      Oh thats mostly old news
14:53 SEJeff      If you're using the new icinga-web (which is very purty)
15:20 ironcamel   pdurbin: see new comment on https://plus.google.com/u/0/107770072576338242009/posts/fu9wVpuDdzy
15:27 ironcamel   pdurbin: with cpanm you can just do cpanm -l ~/perl5 Mojolicious
15:27 ironcamel   you don't even need the -l if you already configured the shell environment variables using local::lib
15:27 ironcamel   much easier than typing perl -MCPAN -Mlocal::lib -e 'CPAN::install(Mojolicious)'
15:30 ironcamel   that mojo stuff is really nice. i should start using that. instead of curl blah | vim - ... and then searching
15:34 pdurbin     mojo get is super nice. and the author is glad we like it: http://twitter.com/kraih/status/199860499171647488
16:04 ironcamel   pdurbin: danceb.in now with anchor links as you requested :) http://danceb.in/TrDpBSeZ4RGhLyZl9DNYg
16:04 ironcamel   https://github.com/throughnothing/Dancebin/pull/1
16:05 pdurbin     ironcamel: wow! i love it!!
16:05 pdurbin     i might need help setting up a paste.greptilian.com
16:05 ironcamel   sure
16:05 ironcamel   it is super simple to deploy
16:06 pdurbin     is there an rpm? :)
16:06 ironcamel   nope
16:07 pdurbin     maybe shuff will make one for me :)
16:07 ironcamel   don't be such a weenie
16:07 pdurbin     heh
16:07 ironcamel   git clone ...
16:07 ironcamel   cd Dancebin
16:07 ironcamel   cpanm --installdeps .
16:07 ironcamel   done
16:07 pdurbin     as root?
16:08 ironcamel   as root, or via local::lib
16:08 pdurbin     i'd rather have an rpm
16:08 ironcamel   cpanm -l ~/perl5 --installdeps . # as a regular user
16:08 ironcamel   then perl -Mlocal::lib ./bin/app.pl
16:09 ironcamel   to run it, if you are using a local::lib
16:09 pdurbin     ironcamel: don't you want to be able to tell people, "just run `yum install perl-Dancebin`"?
16:09 pdurbin     (or apt-get)
16:09 ironcamel   but how will it get into the yum repos?
16:09 ironcamel   i have no control over that
16:09 pdurbin     sure you do. anyone does
16:10 ironcamel   really?
16:10 pdurbin     this is how i can (ultimately) run `yum install ikiwiki` (another perl project): https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/ikiwiki
16:11 pdurbin     in short, your app just need to be added to fedora
16:11 ironcamel   who is the gatekeeper for that?
16:12 pdurbin     New package process for existing contributors - FedoraProject - http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/New_package_process_for_existing_contributors
16:12 pdurbin     Packaging:ReviewGuidelines - FedoraProject - http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Packaging:ReviewGuidelines
16:12 ironcamel   15 steps!?
16:13 ironcamel   ridonkulous
16:13 pdurbin     if you don't want to bother with the fedora project, it could be added to http://repoforge.org
16:14 ironcamel   it is easier to just use the cpanm package manager :)
16:14 pdurbin     sure
16:15 pdurbin     back to the fedora project for a second. . . here's a package "review request" example: Bug 773470 – Review Request: muffin - Window and compositing manager based on Clutter - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=773470
16:15 pdurbin     which lead to https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/muffin
16:16 pdurbin     it's all very transparent
16:16 pdurbin     repoforge has *much* less ceremony :)
16:27 whorka      speak of which, I just got my update to mod_fastcgi accepted there, per http://whorka.github.com/blog/2012/02/08/apache-mod_fastcgi-suexec-php-apc-rhel.html
16:30 pdurbin_m   whorka: \o/ I've been meaning to nag you about that post! you filled it in!
16:31 pdurbin_m   I'm totally setting this up on my home server
16:32 whorka      yeah, I was a little less kind to the mod_fcgid developers in my abbreviated comment in the .spec, but i hope the extended explanation at the bottom of the blog post makes up for it.
16:32 whorka      nothing wrong with mod_fcgid, just different design decisions
17:05 Pax         is there anyone in chat thats using anchors for ordering?
17:05 Pax         in puppet?
17:20 pdurbin     Anchor Pattern - Puppet - Puppet Labs - http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/puppet/wiki/Anchor_Pattern ?
17:25 gridiron    Pax: I will check with my house mate, he is the puppet master. Though a bit of a slum lord, too.
17:26 pdurbin     gridiron: i think you're new here... welcome!
17:26 gridiron    I am... I am Pax's house mate. :)
17:26 Pax         pdurbin: yup! I'm working on an update to my iscsid and multipath modules, and I'm trying to decide if I need anchors, or if stages will be enough
17:27 Pax         gridiron: already calling me a slumlord.. sheesh…
17:27 pdurbin     wow. house of geeks. i haven't turned my daughters into geeks. . . yet!
17:28 gridiron    Already? Where have you been?
17:32 gridiron    I do have a current hunch with files descriptors, so if it does crash today during your shift check out the FS descriptors
17:32 gridiron    Damn it... Windows focus does not  follow eyes. Can we work on that?
17:32 SEJeff      Get a kinect?
17:43 pdurbin     "if you try to use an opcode cacher with mod_fcgid, you end up with a cache per processes which nullifies the point of the opcode cache." -- Re: [users@httpd] Optimizing mod_fcgid - http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/httpd-users/201003.mbox/%3C20100324193501.GA2363@bitz.org%3E via http://whorka.github.com/blog/2012/02/08/apache-mod_fastcgi-suexec-php-apc-rhel.html
17:49 pdurbin     Puppet Camp 2012: Boston, Massachusetts - Friday, June 22, 2012 from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM (ET) Cambridge, MA -- http://puppetcampboston.eventbrite.com
17:49 pdurbin     "Puppet Camp is a community oriented gathering of Puppet users and developers. You’ll have the opportunity to network with a diverse group of Puppet users, benefit from insightful lectures delivered by prominent community members, and be able to share experiences and discuss potential implementations of Puppet during our attendee generated breakout sessions."
18:27 pdurbin     here i go asking users if i can reboot their VM like a sucker. didn't realize i can just allocate more ram and ask the user to reboot whenever
18:33 pdurbin     huh. i didn't know fedora was on arm. . . http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM via http://irclog.perlgeek.de/salt/2012-05-08#i_5560123
18:34 SEJeff_work Fedora on arm was recently (a 3-4 weeks ago) almost promoted to a primary supported arch
18:34 SEJeff_work But it still needs a bit more love before that happens
18:35 SEJeff_work http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Architectures/ARM/Planning/Primary
20:19 pdurbin     heh. mailman says "subscribees". google says "Did you mean: subscribers"
20:36 whorka      would the list itself be the subscribee?
23:05 SEJeff_work Anyone here play with openflow?
