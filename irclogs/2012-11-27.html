13:49 pdurbin      jimi_c: and will the jenkins installation be public like http://jenkins.saltstack.org ?

18:41 miah         moin
18:45 pdurbin      miah: west coast is just getting up
18:47 miah         lol. nah. ive been up for a few hours. but just got into work like 20 minutes ago.. ~10:30
19:30 * pdurbin    glances at Best Practical: What's New in 4: Fast full-text searching - http://blog.bestpractical.com/2011/06/full-text-searching.html
20:58 sjoeboo_     so, I've got a couple iscsi luns, string together w/ mdadm. need to mount that md device on boot...._netdev seems to be failing me....anyone have some thoughts?
21:09 pdurbin      sjoeboo_: this is kind of the problem, right? Preventing a RAID device from starting until all disks are ready - http://board.issociate.de/thread/506258/Preventing-a-RAID-device-from-starting-until-all-disks-are-ready.html
21:11 sjoeboo_     roughly, yes
21:11 sjoeboo_     not sure yet whats stopping it, if needs bits are not up yet, or if it simply isn't aut assembling the raid device
21:12 sjoeboo_     currently reboot will give me a better idea
21:13 pdurbin      this might be helpful: raid - Can you disable automatic mdadm startup? - Server Fault - http://serverfault.com/questions/313548/can-you-disable-automatic-mdadm-startup
21:28 miah         sjoeboo_: are you using mpath at all or just using the devices directly?
21:28 sjoeboo_     mpath
21:29 sjoeboo_     i have/had the uuid in mdadm.conf, now i'm going to try jsut putting in the mpath device names, those won't change
21:29 miah         i would assume you can do something in your settings there that will help then. its been a while since i dealt with mpath directly though.
21:29 miah         ya
21:30 miah         (even longer since i dealt with iscsi)
22:40 magoo_       firefox is making me fucking rage
22:50 codex        I was just able to buy a Nexus 4 by automating the trying to checkout
22:50 codex        it took a bit &gt;100 tries
22:50 * codex      -&gt; win
22:51 magoo_       haha, i just realized i typed that in the wrong room - the statement still stands though
22:57 codex        miah: that sucks (just read up about goatcheese.org :))
22:58 miah         ah ya
22:58 miah         i lost it in ~2001
22:58 miah         back when to prove ownership you had to _fax_ in a form
22:58 miah         the form had a upc on it so they could tie it to your ticket
22:59 miah         so they kept claiming they never received my fax
22:59 miah         or that they were unable to locate it
22:59 miah         i offered to take a digital photo and they refused. i suppose that technology was 'too new' then still =)
23:00 miah         anyways. lesson learned: never give network solutions your money
23:00 miah         thankfully there are other registrars these days
23:03 miah         woo. i just did awesome things to my graphite cookbook. now to do some more testing and hacking for a new release.
23:03 miah         lwrp around carbon_cache instances
23:03 miah         starting to build a lwrp around the config file
