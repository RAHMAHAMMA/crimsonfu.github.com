16:08 pdurbin      ijstokes: sounds pretty awesome. you might want to share it here: Scientific Python - Google+ - https://plus.google.com/communities/108773711053400791849
20:02 melodie      hello
20:41 IanSR        pdurbin: are you at IQSS? A SEAS grad student just asked if I had any contacts there and he's looking for some social science "computing" summer project to work on.
20:42 melodie      IanSR hi, what is "social science computing?"
20:42 IanSR        The kind of stuff IQSS does!
20:43 melodie      I would guess about "social science", about "computing", but both together,
20:43 melodie      ?
20:43 IanSR        quantitative social science, statistical analysis, some kinds of econometrics, etc.
20:43 IanSR        Google for "digital humanities".

20:43 IanSR        You go crimsonfubot!
20:43 semiosis     ha
20:44 melodie      thanks IanSR
21:09 pdurbin      IanSR: yes, I'm back at IQSS now: http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~pdurbin
21:12 pdurbin      IanSR: maybe see if any of these programs interest him: http://www.iq.harvard.edu/books/programs
21:12 pdurbin      I think IQSS has a pretty broad definition of what constitutes social science :)
