02:25 codex     hydrajump: i just deployed a new infra for docker + dokku
02:26 codex     pdurbin: you are actually part of the beta group which will get access early to mid next week
02:26 codex     I use irssi btw in a screen session but I like some of the weechat features
02:34 codex     this is pretty sick: http://www.weechat.org/about/screenshots/weechat_2012-04-14_sembei.png/
02:34 codex     i really like some of the scripts available for weechat
12:31 hydrajump codex can you share any details about your docker + dokku setup? Dokku is only for a single host, right? Is this for personal use or production? Why not Flynn instead of dokku as it seems to be more towards multiple hosts, scaling etc.
12:31 * pdurbin didn't know he was part of a beta group
12:32 pdurbin   this is my favorite weechat script: hotlist2extern.pl: waiting for hotlist to change and then execute a user specified command or writes the hotlist to screen title - http://www.weechat.org/scripts/source/hotlist2extern.pl.html/
12:40 pdurbin   so I was listening to this: 5by5 | The Changelog #118: The Sass Way and Open Publishing with John Long - http://5by5.tv/changelog/118
12:41 pdurbin   and they were talking about how they like Jekyll but sometimes they find it too blog-oriented, depending on what they're doing
12:41 pdurbin   sometimes they just want a static site generator that for more generic content than blogs
12:41 pdurbin   and they both really like this thing called Middleman that I hadn't heard of: http://middlemanapp.com
