01:24 bene      that mini intel atom box is pretty interesting as a pfsense base
01:25 bene      i have an alix 2d2 board for current firewall
01:27 bene      i was thinking of upgrading to an alix apu board, but it's $230+ for case and all the bits
01:28 pdurbin   sounds expensive
01:29 pdurbin   :)
01:29 bene      semiosis: have you thrown your pfsense box on a kill-a-watt to get a power usage reading?
01:29 bene      it's both expensive and cheap depending on how you value your time
01:29 * pdurbin looks at https://gitlab.com based on the tweet by semiosis
01:30 bene      the alix stuff has all the industrial use ratings for RF interference, temperatures and varying power quality
01:30 bene      so it's rock solid
01:30 bene      whereas your $50 best buy router will die after a year because it overheats and the caps go to hell
01:31 pdurbin   bene: you're reminding me that my wife pointed out that xkcd stole my idea: Hard Reboot - http://xkcd.com/1495/ :)
01:32 pdurbin   although in my case I put my "server" on a lamp timer so it wouldn't keep us awake at night in our crappy basement Fenway apartment
01:32 bene      it's a sad state of affairs when you login to a server and run 'crontab -l' and see:
01:32 bene      0 1 * * * /sbin/reboot
01:43 pdurbin   heh: Heroku | No such app - https://ello.co./
01:43 pdurbin   via https://indiewebcamp.com/Ello
02:02 bene      gitlab is pretty nice
02:03 bene      i set up an in-house server for us to bang on at work
02:04 pdurbin   cool
21:14 pdurbin   I've got this demo app deploying on Vagrant. Would anyone like to add Docker support? https://github.com/pdurbin/addressbookmvc/tree/master/examples/javaee7/src/test/deploy/vagrant
21:20 melodie   hi pdurbin
21:21 melodie   I have pointed someone from my region to the wonderstudy page, and he has provided a pull request, could you have a look?
21:21 melodie   he and I have been talking about the coding 4 o'clock because they are going to organize one for adults too (coding aperitive or so)
21:23 pdurbin   melodie: https://github.com/wonderstudy/wonderstudy.github.io/pull/3 looks good. you should go ahead and click "merge"
21:24 melodie   let me look how to do that
21:24 melodie   ok I sign in
21:27 melodie   pdurbin how can I display the diff?
21:27 melodie   https://github.com/nnodot/wonderstudy.github.io/commit/134a3f250cb476b84d95493ec178e9172186cc24 this?
21:29 melodie   I have the hardest time browsing in github
21:29 melodie   now I can't find again the page where I can click to merge!
21:30 melodie   ok merged
21:31 melodie   I'll ask him a crash course related to github when I meet him
21:31 melodie   that will be useful
