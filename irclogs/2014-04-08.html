15:21 semiosis  found out that JMX stops working when java runs out of heap space :(
15:22 semiosis  also found out there's a JVM argument to make a heap dump when it runs out of heap space :)
15:22 semiosis  -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=/tmp
15:23 pdurbin   huh
19:21 semiosis  fun stuff! https://gist.github.com/mitsuhiko/10130454
19:21 semiosis  heartbleed exploit code
19:22 semiosis  just point it at your https web server & it will spit out cookies (incl. session IDs) from users
19:46 pdurbin   is ssh affected or "just" https?
20:00 pdurbin   seems like all the tests are for port 443
20:08 semiosis  idk
20:08 semiosis  wondering about openvpn as well
20:11 pdurbin   "It's worth pointing out that OpenSSH is not affected by the OpenSSL bug" -- http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/55076/what-should-a-website-operator-do-about-the-heartbleed-openssl-exploit
20:12 pdurbin   oh, that reminds me... new blog from one of the #crimsonfu co-founders: http://someguyontheinter.net
20:12 pdurbin   "it must be true!"
20:13 pdurbin   "The vulnerability does not affect openssh it affects openssl" -- http://serverfault.com/questions/587414/do-i-need-to-replace-keys-for-openssh-in-response-to-heartbleed
20:22 hydrajump semiosis I think openvpn is fine as long as the version of openssl it uses doesn't have the heart bleed vulnerability.
20:22 semiosis  it's fine if it's fine
20:23 semiosis  but what i want to know is, is it fine if it's *not* fine?
20:23 hydrajump do you guys know of a travis-ci free solution for private code? Something that either hosted or easily self-hosted.
20:23 semiosis  jenkins
20:24 semiosis  searchbot: lucky jenkins ci
20:24 searchbot semiosis: http://jenkins-ci.org/
20:24 semiosis  yep
20:24 hydrajump isn't that a big complex thing to setup for someone who hasn't setup CI before?
20:25 hydrajump I saw something called magnum-ci.com
20:26 semiosis  haha
20:26 semiosis  like magnum pi
20:26 semiosis  this looks really cool, thanks!
20:27 semiosis  love that they support gitlab
20:27 semiosis  too bad they dont support java though :(
20:30 hydrajump yeah name is awesome. Don't know how the service is compared to say travis
20:30 pdurbin   Magnum CI - Hosted Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment Platform - https://magnum-ci.com
20:30 pdurbin   nice
20:30 hydrajump their mascot is awesome. If you tweet them they'll send you a sticker apparently
