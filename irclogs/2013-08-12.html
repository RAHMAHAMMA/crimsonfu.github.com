16:46 pdurbin since I had trouble finding where to set the footer in mailman... it's under "Footer added to mail sent to regular list members
16:46 pdurbin here, for example: TechTalkFollowup Administration (Non-digestÂ options) - https://lists.iq.harvard.edu/mailman/admin/techtalkfollowup/nondigest
16:48 whorka  (and there's a separate page for the footer sent to digest subscribers)
