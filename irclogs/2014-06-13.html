21:06 pdurbin   Phew! As of the commit below. I'm able to communicate with the Identity Provider (IdP) at http://testshib.org by having PageKite forward ports that Vagrant is forwarding from a CentOS virtual machine running on my MacBook. I can barely believe it works. What a pain. Next I guess I'll try to configure Netbeans running on my Mac to deploy to Glassfish that's running on the Vagrant CentOS VM rather than

An alternative to Vagrant would be to install Apache and Shibboleth via MacPorts: http://shibboleth.net/pipermail/users/2014-April/014923.html For now, I've documented the Vagrant approach in the dev guide. I'd be happy to help others get set up for Shibboleth development. Phil p.s. The commit: set up shib in Vagrant port forwarding to PageKite #2657 · 728b31a ·
