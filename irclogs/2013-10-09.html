11:24 pdurbin   I have a weird GNOME 3 or Fedora problem. The pointer randomly clicks sometimes! I saw this under Fedora 16 and recently wiped and installed Fedora 19. The problem is back, apparently, and I'm not sure why. I haven't been able to pinpoint it. :(
11:24 * pdurbin turns off one-click shopping
