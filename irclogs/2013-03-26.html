17:50 JoeJulian_   pdurbin: For root it and install cyanogenmod.
17:50 JoeJulian_   for? I swear I typed "just"
17:50 pdurbin      :)
17:58 JoeJulian_   rackerhacker: my wife's a fraud analyst. Her company (apparently) uses a single salt for storing password hashes, a practice not considered appropriate for security, but this allows for better fraud analysis as fraudsters typically use the same password for their many accounts. What's your take on that?
17:59 rackerhacker oof
17:59 JoeJulian_   Hehe
17:59 rackerhacker that's a weird situation
17:59 rackerhacker i'd still go with a different salt per password, honestly
17:59 rackerhacker the value of customer creds is higher than the damaged caused by fraud IMHO
18:00 JoeJulian_   Unless your company can no longer accept VISA due to excessive chargeback rates.
18:03 JoeJulian_   If you can't take payments, your password table is very secure because it's offline.
18:06 JoeJulian_   So if your fraud team came to you and said they needed a tool to be able to identify something like this, what would you do? I'm no math genius, but I wonder if there's a lossy protocol that would be more-likely to generate duplicate hashes (so couldn't be used for rainbow tables) that could be associated with the password in addition to the specific hash for password matching...
18:07 JoeJulian_   I'm asking because I'd like to do something similar for another unique piece of data that I don't want leaked, but I do need to be able to log and track.
18:09 JoeJulian_   ... I use the philosophy that if you write it to disk, it's leaked (even though that's technically still true in ram as well).
