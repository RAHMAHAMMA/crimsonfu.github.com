Time  Nick         Message
12:37 pdurbin      almost all caught up on the /dev/hell podcast. it's pretty good. i'm part way through Episode 17: This Show Is Terrible - /dev/hell - http://devhell.info/post/2012-07-24/this-show-is-terrible/
12:38 pdurbin      only took me two weeks: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-07-20#i_5830373
14:28 pdurbin      Nagios Service Check Acceptor... NSCA is an addon that allows you to send passive check results from remote Linux/Unix hosts to the Nagios daemon running on the monitoring server. -- http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/3_0/addons.html#nsca . so not through NRPE...
14:30 pdurbin      Nagios Remote Plugin Executor. i keep wanting to call it NPRE...
14:31 shuff        NSCA == how Nagios scales for performance
14:31 pdurbin      i don't know if we're using NSCA or not... looking
14:31 shuff        how many Nagios servers do you have?
14:32 pdurbin      one
14:32 shuff        i will be quite surprised if you are using NSCA somewhere
14:32 pdurbin      well, that's not true. we have an old one too. and one on amazon
14:32 shuff        oho
14:32 shuff        does the one on amazon feed its results back to your local server?
14:32 pdurbin      nope. all are standalone
14:33 shuff        ok
14:33 shuff        then prolly no NSCA
14:33 pdurbin      so i want to run a command on a server other than the nagios server
14:33 pdurbin      and feed the results into nagios... probably as a passive check, i guess...
14:34 pdurbin      i guess i could have nrpe execute it...
14:34 pdurbin      might be easier
14:34 shuff        do you want Nagios to initiate the command? then NRPE, or an active check that uses SSH or SNMP or some other remote access
14:35 pdurbin      i'm ok with the nagios server initiating the command, but i don't want it to run every 10 minutes or whatever. once a day is enough
14:35 shuff        that's fine; you can set the check period appropriately in the nagios config
14:36 pdurbin      ok. i was hoping
14:36 pdurbin      i can just do this on a per-check basis?
14:38 shuff        set a different check period per check?  yes, you can
14:39 pdurbin      do you have the syntax handy? or a doc?
14:39 pdurbin      hmm, maybe it's called interval
14:40 shuff        http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/nagioscore/3/en/activechecks.html
14:40 shuff        When Are Active Checks Executed?
14:40 shuff        Active check are executed:
14:40 shuff        •	At regular intervals, as defined by the check_interval and retry_interval options in your host and service definitions
14:40 shuff        •	On-demand as needed
14:43 pdurbin      thanks. looks like the value is in minutes
14:44 pdurbin      huh. it's "time units" apparently
14:44 pdurbin      'check_interval: This directive is used to define the number of "time units" to wait before scheduling the next "regular" check of the service.' - Object Definitions - http://nagios.sourceforge.net/docs/nagioscore/3/en/objectdefinitions.html#service
14:45 pdurbin      "Unless you've changed the interval_length directive from the default value of 60, this number will mean minutes."

16:40 whorka       I am currently packaging all the RT 4 dependencies for RHEL5, since epel is still on RT 3.
16:41 pdurbin      right, i was just looking at https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/rt3
16:41 pdurbin      at least they're on the latest 3.8
16:41 pdurbin      but whorka
16:42 pdurbin      are you open sourcing your spec files?
16:42 pdurbin      please please please please please
16:42 whorka       yep
16:42 pdurbin      \o/
16:42 whorka       they'll be at http://mirror.hmdc.harvard.edu/HMDC-RT/el5/SRPMS/
16:42 pdurbin      cool. and we can rebuild them for el6
16:42 whorka       and if I find the time I'll push them to repoforge too
16:43 pdurbin      that's fine
16:43 pdurbin      whorka: had you considered contacting the maintainers of https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/rt3 ?
16:44 pdurbin      asking them if they plan to build rt4 packages?
16:44 whorka       not especially, since they're release cycle is pretty slow.
16:44 whorka       I suppose it couldn't hurt to ask though.
16:44 pdurbin      slow? what do you mean?
16:45 pdurbin      like i said, they have the latest rt 3.8
16:45 pdurbin      http://pkgs.fedoraproject.org/gitweb/?p=rt3.git;a=blob;f=rt3.spec;hb=HEAD
16:45 pdurbin      %changelog
16:45 pdurbin      * Sat Jul 21 2012 Fedora Release Engineering
16:46 whorka       yeah I meant the RT 4 release
16:47 whorka       although the RHEL5 build of RT3 has been out of date for a while too http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/5/x86_64/repoview/rt3.html
16:48 whorka       some thought was given to targeting RHEL6 for the upgrade, but we haven't ported the base of our configuration management yet.
16:48 pdurbin      sure. that makes sense
16:49 whorka       we do have someone actively working on starting clean with puppet for our RHEL6 management
16:49 pdurbin      anyway, i always go to the fedora pkgdb first. since that's what goes in fedora, rhel, and epel
16:50 pdurbin      whorka: cool. we use puppet too. love it
16:55 pdurbin      whorka: any plans to contribute to epel some day?
16:58 pdurbin      this keeps coming up :) http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-05-18#i_5609330
17:53 pdurbin      spowers: racktables api coming to github: http://www.freelists.org/post/racktables-users/writing-a-restful-API-in-php-for-Racktables,26
18:33 pdurbin      http://blog dot jamesdotcuff dot net: GCE part II - fun with the API - http://blog.jcuff.net/2012/08/gce-part-ii-fun-with-api.html
18:34 pdurbin      Module of the Week: pupplabs/node_gce - Google Compute Engine Plugin | Puppet Labs - http://puppetlabs.com/blog/module-of-the-week-puppetlabs-node_gce-google-compute-engine-plugin/
19:14 pdurbin      shuff: i get -v and -vvvv out of the box with http://search.cpan.org/~tonvoon/Nagios-Plugin-0.36/lib/Nagios/Plugin/Getopt.pm
19:15 pdurbin      -v 5 doesn't work, but i can live with that
19:18 agperson     to the room: do you use a datacenter designation in your hostnames?
19:19 pdurbin      nope. i think sejeff said he does/did
19:19 pdurbin      i miss sejeff :(
19:22 pdurbin      agperson: we're storing the data center location in puppet facts, pulled from racktables
19:22 agperson     i've been populating the puppet fact from the hostname ;) — but that's obviously backwards
19:24 pdurbin      to each his own :)
19:25 agperson     pdurbin: well, i'm trying to decide on Yet Another Naming Convention (™)
19:25 pdurbin      trees
19:25 pdurbin      dwarves
19:25 pdurbin      birds
19:29 pdurbin      shuff: is it overkill to use Nagios::Plugin when writing an nrpe check script?  from this it looks like I can just return a code and print a message: Nagios and OP5 – writing a nrpe check script | KMG Group - http://www.kmggroup.ch/?p=126
19:33 shuff        it is never overkill to use Nagios::Plugin when writing checks :)
19:33 shuff        that was easy
19:33 pdurbin      yeah, there's some handy stuff in there
19:33 pdurbin      $np-&gt;nagios_exit( 1, "foo" );
19:34 shuff        aka $np-&gt;nagios_die( "foo" );
19:34 pdurbin      # nagios_die() is just like nagios_exit(), but return code defaults
19:34 pdurbin      #   to UNKNOWN
19:34 pdurbin      right
19:34 shuff        no, i am not right
19:35 shuff        that would be 3, not 1
19:35 pdurbin      oh, right. 1 is WARNING
19:35 pdurbin      WARNING i say
21:19 whorka       wow RT has a lot of prerequisites http://mirror.hmdc.harvard.edu/HMDC-RT/el5/SRPMS/
21:22 whorka       if you're going to use those srpms, pdurbin, beware that although they're tagged "noarch" some may actually be x86_64
21:23 whorka       sorry, the rpms rather
21:34 pdurbin      whorka: that's fine. we're all x86_64
21:34 pdurbin      no rt4 rpm itself... YET! :)
21:35 whorka       hopefully tomorrow it will be there
21:36 pdurbin      \o/
21:36 whorka       to answer your earlier question I haven't thought much about contributing to epel. I thought my contributions to rpmforge would've put me on an auto blacklist there or something. :)
21:36 pdurbin      heh
21:38 shuff        no no, you'll get the same bureaucratic hurdles as anybody else :) let me know when you've found another packager willing to sponsor you
21:39 whorka       do we have any authorized epel packagers in the room?
