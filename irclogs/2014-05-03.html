18:39 * bene     sighs
20:47 pdurbin    bene: tgames?
20:48 bene       t to open a new tab in pentadactyl and games to access a bookmark
20:50 pdurbin    searchbot`: lucky pentadactyl
20:51 searchbot` pdurbin: http://5digits.org/pentadactyl/
20:51 pdurbin    ah
20:52 pdurbin    bene: sorry I didn't get a chance to chat at the meeting yesterday (or even stay). so busy
21:00 pdurbin    I feel bad for grabbing a sandwich but not staying until the end.
21:04 bene       i left early too
21:04 bene       hms is not participating in the office365 stuff
21:05 bene       so not only uninteresting but also irrelevant!
21:13 pdurbin_m  bene: heh. yeah, I'm not so into Microsoft stuff
21:14 pdurbin_m  too many Halloween documents
21:42 hydrajump  anyone used dokku https://github.com/progrium/dokku /cc codex
21:50 pdurbin_m  nice tag line. 100 lines of bash
21:58 hydrajump  Those of you on OS X do you use textualapp for your IRC client or something else?
22:20 hydrajump  http://selfstarter.us/ roll your own crowdfunding
22:25 pdurbin    hydrajump: I run weechat in a screen session on my linux vm in the cloud and ssh into it from os x (and linux)
22:26 hydrajump  pdurbin digital ocean?
22:27 pdurbin    nope. hosted by codex. great uptime
22:51 hydrajump  pdurbin I'm checking out weechat now thanks
23:24 pdurbin    hydrajump: is has different bugs than irssi at least
23:24 pdurbin    it*
23:29 hydrajump  I'm not a power IRC user and have only used the Textual app. I'm looking at alternatives especially considering that if I quit the app I lose any ongoing conversations. I know semiosis has mentioned znc in the past. I've looked at irssi, ircanywhere and now weechat.
23:30 pdurbin    IRC was a mess for me until I got set up with irssi in a screen session
23:31 pdurbin    generally, my technique for not losing ongoing conversations is to only hang out in channels that are publicly logged :)
23:33 pdurbin    I'm bummed though... there were a few channels I liked that were logged at http://www.evanchooly.com but now they aren't and the logs are all gone :(
23:34 pdurbin    I guess it goes to show you should do your own channel logging.
23:37 pdurbin    and backup those logs to bene's server if he'll let you :)
