15:04 * pdurbin runs `brew install coreutils` and wonders if this is a bad idea
15:06 pdurbin   oh, interesting... "All commands have been installed with the prefix 'g'."
15:06 pdurbin   export PATH="/Users/pdurbin/.homebrew/opt/coreutils/libexec/gnubin:$PATH"
15:07 pdurbin   of course, as it turns out, i meant to run `brew install findutils`
