00:12 larsks       Coming late to the party...but SecurID has the same problem when using software tokens (and honestly, the way FAS has distributed the software keys makes it mostly a joke).
00:14 larsks       We are seriously looking at Google Authenticator as a replacement for SecurID.
00:33 pdurbin_m    whorka: nothing, but the rsa secureid software works the same way, as I understand it
00:36 pdurbin_m    larsks: that's what our solution is built on https://github.com/fasrc/openauth-puppet
00:37 pdurbin_m    Time-based One-time Password (TOTP) algorithm specified in RFC 6238, using the google-authenticator PAM module
00:42 larsks       Cool.
00:44 pdurbin_m    Boo. Could not prettify this RFC The source XML for this RFC isn't available, therefore it can't be reformatted. http://pretty-rfc.herokuapp.com/RFC6238
00:48 pdurbin_m    http://crypto.stackexchange.com/questions/2220/what-are-the-advantages-of-totp-over-hotp

15:36 gridiron     Whoa! This is genius. https://github.com/videlalvaro/gifsockets
15:38 semiosis     back in the late 90s i set up a webcam stream on an sgi indy which was delivered by an endless animated gif
15:38 semiosis     worked like a champ even back then
15:40 gridiron     I never would have thought about it
15:46 * semiosis   wonders if that would fill the browser's cache until the disk was full
17:00 ironcamel    pdurbin: Bug #79648 for App-p: Integrate Data::DPath to App::p https://rt.cpan.org/Public/Bug/Display.html?id=79648 ... what do you think?
17:57 pdurbin      gridiron: that's nuts. i love it
17:59 pdurbin      ironcamel: so... p ' dd ((xl r "/etc/xml/xml-core.xml") ~~ dpath "//catalog" )'
17:59 pdurbin      it take it dpath is like xpath?
17:59 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: google Data::DPath
17:59 crimsonfubot pdurbin: Data::DPath - search.cpan.org: &lt;http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?Data::DPath&gt;; Steffen Schwigon / Data-DPath - search.cpan.org: &lt;http://search.cpan.org/dist/Data-DPath/&gt;; Steffen Schwigon - search.cpan.org: &lt;http://search.cpan.org/~schwigon/&gt;; App::DPath - search.cpan.org: &lt;http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App%3A%3ADPath&gt;; dpath - cmdline tool around Data::DPath - metacpan.org: (2 more messages)
18:00 pdurbin      heh. "Data::DPath - DPath is not XPath!" :)
18:00 pdurbin      "XPath is for XML. DPath is for data structures, with a stronger Perl focus." mmm
18:00 pdurbin      ironcamel: ship it
19:02 pdurbin      http://xiki.org - Xiki: A shell console with GUI features. Xiki does what shell consoles do, but lets you edit everything at any time. It's trivial to make your own commands and menus to access other tools.
19:08 gridiron     Been playing around with that. It sits on emacs
19:08 gridiron     They need documentation help if you have time
19:10 pdurbin      only just hit my radar
19:11 pdurbin      tychoish: emacs! ^^ docs! :)
19:47 pdurbin      right... so i just changed a host's subnet from 255.255.255.0 to 255.255.255.128 and i can still reach it. i forget why this works or what it's called
19:56 whorka       128 dec is 10000000, so you just widened the subnet mask by one bit.
19:58 comptona     pdurbin: the netmask is just used to tell the tcp stack which hosts are considered local for routing purposes
19:58 comptona     you could make the netmask 255.255.255.252 on one of the machines, and if the IP addresses fit properly it'd still work
19:59 pdurbin      "If your ISP has assigned your organization multiple contiguous subnets, see if you can determine the network prefix they use for routing to you by entering the top and bottom IP addresses you own, then widening the network mask until they are on the same subnet" -- http://www.ipprimer.com/subnet.cfm
20:01 whorka       If we were writing in CIDR notation it would be /24 vs /25 as per http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing#IPv4_CIDR_blocks
20:01 pdurbin      comptona: hmm. thanks. unfortunately, the ip i'm using doesn't fit in the /26 subnet
20:01 pdurbin      so i can't test it. but i believe you guys :)
20:02 pdurbin      i guess people just call this "widening the subnet", like whorka said
21:32 ventz        Why spotify didn't exist in the 80s: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSxEm8LGWuA
21:32 ventz        :)
21:47 semiosis     pdurbin: if DST_HOST &amp; NETMASK == SRC_HOST &amp; NETMASK, then the remote host is local and an ARP request is sent to find its mac address.  otherwise an ARP is sent for the mac addr of the default gateway (or specific gateway if there is a route for the specific network)
21:48 semiosis     &amp; is bitwise AND
21:51 semiosis     a problem i like to present to subnetting n00bs is to give them an odd numerical range of IPs and ask them to find the optimal set of CIDR-subnets to match that range
22:02 semiosis     like 10.0.0.17 - 10.0.0.67
22:34 semiosis     possibly a good interview question... hmmm
