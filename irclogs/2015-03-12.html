02:55 mhayden   pdurbin: talking to mr. cuff about meeting up as well
10:38 pdurbin   nice
17:46 semiosis  anyone know how i can get textual to add a colon & space after a nick when using tab completion?
17:48 * pdurbin hasn't heard of textual
17:49 semiosis  pdurbinwhat irc client do you use on your mac?
17:51 pdurbin   I ssh to my server and attach to the screen session running weechat.
17:53 semiosis  wow thats hardcore.  i remember the days of running bitchx in a screen
17:54 semiosis  ...back in high school lol
17:54 semiosis  thanks anyway
18:03 pdurbin   semiosis: I thought you had some fancy ZNC bouncer thing.
18:51 bene      bitchx + screen -> irssi + tmux
18:51 bene      time to upgrade, man
18:55 semiosis  pdurbin: i do use znc but that's just a proxy, not a client.  now that i've switched to a mac i'm using textual for the client
18:55 semiosis  bene: yeah
18:56 semiosis  bene: bitchx + screen -> konversation + kde -> textual + yosemite
18:57 pdurbin   get off my lawn
18:57 semiosis  rofl
20:26 semiosis  the fine folks in #textual helped me out.
20:28 pdurbin   what was the fix?
20:51 semiosis  it was buried deep in the preferences
20:51 semiosis  but there's a field where you can set what chars to add after a nickname completion
20:51 semiosis  default is empty
20:52 semiosis  also turns out that textual was inspired by konversation :)
20:56 semiosis  pdurbin: ^
21:07 pdurbin   ah. that one I've used. back in the day
21:08 * pdurbin reaches for his cane
