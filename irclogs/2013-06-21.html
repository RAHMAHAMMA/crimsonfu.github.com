12:35 pdurbin   mhayden: I just listened to http://major.io/2013/06/19/my-interview-on-the-dave-and-gunnar-show/ ... good stuff
12:36 pdurbin   I didn't know RHEL7 was getting a "classic mode" for GNOME
12:37 * pdurbin looks at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/Gnome3.8#Classic_mode
12:39 pdurbin   there's talk of classic mode here too: https://help.gnome.org/misc/release-notes/3.8/
13:00 mhayden   classic mode isn't bad looking
13:04 pdurbin   I'm taking a vacation day. thinking of wiping my fedora 16 laptop and putting 19 beta on it
13:04 pdurbin   so maybe I'll be able to check out classic mode
15:22 pdurbin   this Fedora 19 beta install has not been without peril
15:23 ben_e     are you wearing your Joo Janta 200 Super-Chromatic Peril Sensitive Sunglasses?
15:24 pdurbin   should be
15:25 pdurbin   I just hope it still boots Windows. I use it to watch Netflix
15:29 pdurbin   oh good, it does
15:29 pdurbin   but now I need a shower
15:37 pdurbin   ah. typing this from the newly installed Fedora 19 laptop
16:06 melodie   pdurbin let us know how this version goes, within a few days? :)
16:21 pdurbin   melodie: so far so good. vagrant works. I'm sure everything else will
16:22 melodie   :D
16:22 melodie   great
16:22 pdurbin   melodie: one weird thing is that my screen is stretched horizontally very wide... not sure why
16:22 pdurbin   and I haven't found a way to fix it yet
16:22 larsks    What pdurbin doesn't know is that *I'm* typing this from his newly installed Fedora 19 laptop, too.  Should have applied those security updates!
16:22 larsks    * not really.
16:23 pdurbin   heh
16:24 pdurbin   ask I was backing up my laptop I found a directory at /root/george
16:24 pdurbin   and I was like "who the hell is george?"
16:24 pdurbin   but them I remembered I helped my friend george recover some photos years ago
16:24 pdurbin   s/ask/as/
16:30 pdurbin   dunno if the wideness is apparent or not, but here's how it looks: https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/fMVMdSyq2UP
16:31 melodie   pdurbin which desktop manager is it?
16:32 pdurbin   gnome 3
16:32 * pdurbin looks at http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Releases/19/FeatureList
16:33 pdurbin   gnome 3.8
16:33 melodie   what is the graphical card?
16:34 melodie   pdurbin do you have the right driver for the card, and what are the choices presented in the console with the command "xrandr" ?
16:37 pdurbin   ah, the resolution should be 1366x768, but Displays under Settings is showing 1024x768 as the only option
16:40 melodie   pdurbin you might be missing the right driver ?
16:41 melodie   can you check in the /var/log/Xorg.0.log which driver is used?
16:53 pdurbin   melodie: the solution was to take out the "nomodeset" kernel parameter when booting. everything is back to normal now
16:55 pdurbin   a guy in #fedora-qa said it was disabling the intel gfx driver
16:57 pdurbin   I'm not sure my exact graphics card but the sales order had "0A59714           SBB 12.5MHDLD BT DLMBR2X2ANT" on it when I ordered this laptop, a ThinkPad X220T (X220 Tablet)
17:07 melodie   pdurbin you would know with the command "lspci | grep VGA" or "lspci | grep Video" sometimes
17:08 melodie   anyhow a "lspci" will provide a bunch and you can find it there
17:08 melodie   usually
17:10 melodie   pdurbin I had not seen you found the solution, talking with a visitor at home :)
17:11 pdurbin   melodie: yes, but the output is pretty generic: 00:02.0 VGA compatible controller: Intel Corporation 2nd Generation Core Processor Family Integrated Graphics Controller (rev 09)
17:13 melodie   oh
17:13 pdurbin   huh, when I ran `grub2-mkconfig` it changed 'set default="0"' to 'set default="${next_entry}"' ... I'm not sure if that's valid or not. I'm used to seeing "0"
17:14 melodie   pdurbin and what is the explanation related to the nomodeset option ?
17:14 melodie   I don't know much about grub2 so far, I have kept grub legacy as long as possible in many machines and I still have one
17:15 melodie   too much to learn at same time!
17:15 melodie   new stuff all around
17:16 pdurbin   a guy in #fedora-qa said it was disabling the intel gfx driver
17:17 pdurbin   melodie: that was the only explanation
17:17 melodie   ah
17:18 pdurbin   he says 'set default="${next_entry}"' is valid. must be a grub2 thing
17:24 pdurbin   must be. I rebooted just fine
17:25 pdurbin   trust but verify :)
17:26 melodie   I looked on the web
17:26 melodie   nomodeset disables kvm which prevents some graphic drivers to load (or to work? not sure exactly)
17:27 melodie   s/kvm/KMS/
17:28 melodie   pdurbin found more here: http://wiki.sugarlabs.org/go/Nomodeset
17:28 melodie   seems very interesting
17:28 pdurbin   heh. "They can all draw pretty pictures"
17:30 pdurbin   "Specifying 'nomodeset' when the system boots basically tells the system to use an older set of software/drivers which does work (but may be slower or have some other issues that people would like to eliminate)."
17:31 melodie   yes
17:31 pdurbin   melodie: KMS?
17:31 melodie   this is the part I found interesting to know about
17:31 melodie   Kernel Mode Setting
17:32 pdurbin   ok
17:32 melodie   found here: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kernel_mode-setting
17:32 melodie   "Doing mode setting in kernel-space is more flexible and allows displaying of an error in the case of a fatal error in the kernel, even when using a user-space display server.
17:32 melodie   User-space mode setting would have needed superuser privileges for direct hardware access, so kernel-based mode setting increases security because the user-space graphics server does not need superuser privileges."
17:33 melodie   ah ha !
17:39 pdurbin   hmm. `yum install gnome-classic-session` to try "classic mode" in gnome 3.8 on fedora 19
17:52 pdurbin   hmm. interesting. all it does is install these extensions: gnome-shell-extension-alternate-tab gnome-shell-extension-apps-menu gnome-shell-extension-common gnome-shell-extension-launch-new-instance gnome-shell-extension-places-menu gnome-shell-extension-window-list
17:52 pdurbin   basically
18:04 larsks    pdurbin: re: grub2, which is terrible and pointlessly complex, mattdm has done work such that syslinux is now an option, too.  If you boot the installer with "syslinux" on the command line you get that instead of grub2.
18:07 pdurbin   huh
18:07 pdurbin   all these newfangled thinggs
18:08 pdurbin   in my day it was lilo and it mattered where it was installed. first 1024 blocks or something
18:09 larsks    lilo is not something I miss :)
18:09 pdurbin   :)
18:18 ben_e     mattdm is matthew miller?
18:22 larsks    ben_e: Yup.
18:23 larsks    Former Harvard colleague, now the Fedora cloud architect, trying to make Fedora more useful in cloud environments.
18:26 larsks    pdurbin: Actually, that's "extlinux" on the command line.  See https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/SyslinuxOption once Matthew finishes updating the page...
18:27 pdurbin   ben_e: he's in our logs. surely you've read them ;)
18:37 ben_e     i know matt
18:38 ben_e     IRL not IRC
18:38 ben_e     i didn't know what his handle was
18:38 larsks    He is generally mattdm@*.
18:39 ben_e     ijstokes and i go out for drinks pretty regularly and matt has come along some times
18:48 pdurbin   ben_e: did he find people for his scientific python thing? pydata or whatever?
18:52 * ben_e   shrugs
18:52 ben_e     i haven't seen him in a bit actually
18:54 pdurbin   here it was: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2013-05-29#i_7128693
18:55 pdurbin   what's new is that the schedule is up: PyData 2013 | Boston, MA | July 27 â€“ 28 - http://www.pydata.org/bos2013/schedule/
18:56 pdurbin   hmm, not sure I've heard of any of these people
19:02 ben_e     justin riley is on there
