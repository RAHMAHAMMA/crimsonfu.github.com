00:10 pdurbin   skay: redhat!
00:10 skay      haha
00:10 skay      weechat stole my focus as I was typing /connect canonical
00:11 skay      I have a friend who works at redhat on centos, and I have a friend who works at fermilab on scientific linux
00:11 pdurbin   I'm just kidding. I'm actually typing from an Ubuntu box at the moment.
00:11 skay      I want to have a picture of us all together in distro swag
00:11 skay      so I can troll my coworkers
00:12 * skay    needs to find more friends who work on more distros
00:12 pdurbin   you can grab prologic too for his distro
00:13 pdurbin   it's so new... I wonder about its SEO
00:13 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky vallinux
00:13 searchbot pdurbin: https://github.com/vallinux/docker-images
00:13 pdurbin   meh, good enough :)
00:13 prologic  haha
00:13 prologic  it comes up :)
00:13 pdurbin   also acceptable would have been http://vallinux.org :)
00:17 pdurbin   skay: melodie has a distro too
00:17 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky bento linux
00:17 searchbot pdurbin: https://github.com/abrasive/bento-linux-build
00:17 pdurbin   :/
00:20 pdurbin   not sure the best homepage for bento. maybe this: http://linuxvillage.org/en/2013/11/bento-ubuntu-remix-rc/
00:20 pdurbin   hmm, maybe http://bentovillage.org
00:25 melodie   hi
00:25 melodie   what's going on?
00:26 melodie   pdurbin the main linuxvillage.org can be a start
00:26 melodie   :)
00:27 melodie   pdurbin have you found someone who wants a free .me for domain? or a free .xyz ?
00:27 melodie   I have one of each to pass on
00:29 pdurbin   melodie: what's the home page for bento?
00:29 melodie   not specific yet
00:30 melodie   linuxvillage.org is where everything starts and it's spreading around little by little
00:30 pdurbin   ok
00:30 melodie   for English users: http://linuxvillage.org/en/
00:30 melodie   for download:
00:30 melodie   http://linuxvillage.org/en/downloads/
00:31 melodie   and there is something starting at Launchpad, to open the project to contributors
00:31 melodie   https://launchpad.net/bento-dev
00:32 melodie   on the linuxvillage forum are announcements
00:32 melodie   A presentation of Bento Linux - http://forum.linuxvillage.org/index.php/topic,701.0.html
00:36 pdurbin   melodie: cool. thanks
00:36 pdurbin   skay: this was interesting: https://plus.google.com/+SheilaMiguez/posts/3Lr1kHV1XeZ :)
00:37 skay      pdurbin: yeah! I haven't decided how all to use it yet
00:37 melodie   pdurbin pleasure!
00:37 skay      most likely I will add a reader the door of my house
00:37 skay      and will add an extra reader to the hackerspace door so that it works with NFC
00:37 skay      it would be even cooler if I could get a yubikey implant
00:38 skay      I've got a huge bruise on my hand, but it doesn't hurt
00:39 melodie   pdurbin haha, same as here : https://meylodie.wordpress.com/2015/04/17/puces-ou-pas-puces-caption-width-640-align/
00:41 pdurbin   skay: so the idea is that there's a chip in your hand and you can wave it in front of the door to your hackerspace to open it. that's why I commented, "weird and cool" :)
00:43 skay      pdurbin: :)
01:23 prologic  skay: hey :)
01:33 skay      prologic: howdy
01:35 skay      pdurbin: this guy was at the talk about biohacking, but he wasn't giving hte presentation. http://motherboard.vice.com/blog/the-diy-cyborg
01:35 skay      that is a bit extreme for me
