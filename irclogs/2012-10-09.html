13:06 ventz        semiosis: that's neat
13:07 pdurbin      agreed. i added it to my "whither thunderbird" post: https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/iA1gyNt31tv
13:08 pdurbin      ventz: is that ios workshop free and open to the public? does one have to register or can one just show up? http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-10-08#i_6044263
13:14 ventz        pdurbin: yes - you have to "register" via facebook i think
13:15 ventz        it's technically not btw, it's for NU CCS students (or any NU student?) but it's hosted by ACM and it's open to the public b/c of that
13:15 pdurbin      huh. i suppose i could join facebook
13:17 ventz        pdurbin: 109 people have said they are going
13:17 ventz        that room (i only know it b/c i used to watch movies there at night/weekends with friends when back in college) cannot hold more than 100
13:17 ventz        so should be interesting
13:18 pdurbin      i'll let you fight it out :) please report back
13:27 ventz        :)
13:27 ventz        these are usually a lot of fun
13:28 ventz        i went to the last 2 ACM events that NU hosted (they are the east coast chapter something) and it was very educational -- if you have the time, i urge you to go
13:29 pdurbin      but maybe not that one. too crowded :)
13:50 jgtimmer     I thought it was announced there would be no more new features for thunderbird?
13:53 pdurbin      jgtimmer: me too, per my g+ post ^^

19:13 JoeJulian    Wow, this is probably going to get the FBI to notice me... Wanted to see how other web sites handle the help thing for CVV on payment pages, so I googled, "card number name address expiration cvv" figuring all those things would be on a payment page. Oof.
19:15 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: google card number name address expiration cvv

19:17 pdurbin      why so slow to kickstart ubuntu VMs i wonder... centos is fine...
19:18 JoeJulian    It's amazing how many credit cards are listed publicly. I'm sure they're probably all deactivated by now but damn.
