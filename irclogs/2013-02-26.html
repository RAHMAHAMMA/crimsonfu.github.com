01:12 JoeJulian   Hah! I think this is the first time I used devops in conversation. I'm being assimilated! http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack/%23openstack.2013-02-26.log at 2013-02-26T01:06:32
01:23 pdurbin     "you’re DevOps’ing it Wrong™ ;)" -- https://twitter.com/anthonygoddard/status/305469228553752576
01:23 pdurbin     in reply to: "Repeat after me: “There is no such thing as a DevOps solution. There is no such thing as a DevOps engineer. There is no DevOps Automation”" -- https://twitter.com/someara/status/305427781297242112
01:26 SEJeff_work devops is a trendy name for a (or wannabe) systems engineer
01:26 SEJeff_work imo
01:26 SEJeff_work a sysadmin who codes is a systems engineer
01:26 SEJeff_work a systems administrator becomes a systems engineer with experience and patience to learn proper automation
01:27 pdurbin     meh, i'm keeping the tag line. sysadmins who code :)
01:28 SEJeff_work But you know what I mean
01:28 SEJeff_work conceptually
01:28 SEJeff_work you can be a jr sysadmin without knowing even shell scripting well
01:28 pdurbin     sure. i have trouble calling myself an engineer though
01:28 pdurbin     i think i may have talked about this already
01:28 SEJeff_work I write code fulltime in support of a team of a dozen+ sysadmins
01:28 SEJeff_work some of who code
01:29 SEJeff_work most of who don't very much
01:29 SEJeff_work So for my position, the distinction seems warranted. I am paid to write tools to help manage a production infra primarily and do very little ops work anymore.
01:29 pdurbin     sure enough: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-04-12#i_5432638
01:29 pdurbin     SEJeff_work: see? we've had this conversation already :)
01:30 pdurbin     but don't let me stop you. it's good to have you back :)
01:30 SEJeff_work :)
01:30 SEJeff_work You still need to read dune
01:30 SEJeff_work And ender's game
01:30 SEJeff_work any self respecting geek should know both of those
01:30 SEJeff_work pdurbin, But for now my friend it is time to go home. Long day at work
01:30 pdurbin     i did read ender's game. didn't care for it
