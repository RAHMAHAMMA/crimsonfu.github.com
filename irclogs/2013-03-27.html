00:07 pdurbin    semiosis: lots of pretty pictures
00:07 pdurbin    I just read this "Bye Bye PDPC" (parent organization of freenode) post and I'm not sur what do make of it: http://blog.freenode.net/2013/03/bye-bye-pdpc/
13:58 melodie    hello
14:09 larsks     Howdy.
14:10 melodie    hi larsks
14:15 melodie    I have an announcement to do about the last test version for a Ubuntu Openbox Remix. It is presented here:
14:15 melodie    http://beta.linuxvillage.net/index.php/topic,248.msg1704.html#new
15:27 pdurbin    melodie: thanks. and more at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/03/27/%23ubuntu-women-project.html
15:27 pdurbin    this sounds great: http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/events/2013/04/schneier ... "I have been thinking about the Internet and power: how the Internet affects power, and how power affects the Internet. Increasingly, those in power are using information technology to increase their power."
15:31 melodie    the topic could make me think of this other one : http://beta.linuxvillage.net/index.php/topic,246.0.html
15:31 melodie    "Our Internet Surveillance State"
15:31 ben_e      ttp://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/our_internet_su.html &lt;- kinda depressing recent post on schneier's blog
15:31 ben_e      http://www.schneier.com/blog/archives/2013/03/our_internet_su.html &lt;- kinda depressing recent post on schneier's blog
15:34 ben_e      yeah, the linuxvillage thing is a repost of his blog post which is a repost of a cnn op-ed i guess
15:35 melodie    pdurbin about vagrant, I'll look if it's packaged for Ubuntu, as for Archlinux, the aur compile is not very good
15:35 melodie    http://pastebin.archlinux.fr/460213
15:36 melodie    as you can see from the messages there
15:36 pdurbin    melodie: there are arch packages at http://downloads.vagrantup.com/tags/v1.1.4
15:38 ben_e      you can install it via ruby gems too iirc
15:39 melodie    pdurbin that package has the same content the same fs as the one built by my system using aur
15:40 melodie    I do use aur, but I do checks with namcaps when I don't know the package yet
15:40 melodie    for all the first installs in fact
15:40 melodie    never seen so many errors and warnings in one before, btw
15:41 melodie    I will continue without it, at least in Archlinux. :)
15:41 melodie    and not a valid path is not a valid path, if the program does not find the libs, it's of no use
15:43 pdurbin    melodie: I let the developer know: http://irclogger.com/.vagrant/2013-03-27#1364398995
15:43 melodie    sure you can
15:44 melodie    pdurbin thank you for this
15:45 melodie    http://packages.ubuntu.com/search?keywords=vagrant&amp;searchon=names&amp;suite=all&amp;section=all
15:45 melodie    it is available from the LTS precise up to the next available Ubuntu versions so I'll try it there
15:46 pdurbin    I've only ever used vagrant on fedora and mac. should work everywhere though :/
15:47 melodie    it has to be packaged the right way, with the compilation chain used at the moment also
15:48 melodie    archlinux is a rolling release distribution so the people who make packages must make sure their work fits with the build tools in use
15:48 melodie    and with the file system organisation
15:49 melodie    at Ubuntu they have talked about replacing the versions in between the LTS by a rolling release one. that will be some fun I believe
15:49 melodie    when it will start really
16:30 semiosis   Trying out andchat while traveling. So far so good
16:33 pdurbin    semiosis: traveling up my way
