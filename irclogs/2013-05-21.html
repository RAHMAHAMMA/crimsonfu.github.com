00:08 melodie  I have a question about what is going on in the center of USA:
00:08 melodie  http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/05/20/18375741-major-damage-as-huge-tornado-rips-through-neighborhoods-south-of-oklahoma-city?lite
00:09 melodie  my question is, isn't there any kind of meteo surveillance which can alert the people long enough before anything starts, and some emergency plan?
00:10 melodie  emergency plans ready to be setup?
00:21 pdurbin  melodie: are there ever tornadoes where you live?
00:24 melodie  no
00:24 melodie  there are small earthshakes but rarely strong, no tornados
00:25 melodie  in 1999 there has been storm, in many places forests were devastated and in other places there were flood, and these where places where the wrong kind of trees had been grown and places where the natural ways of the water had been modified: mainly
00:26 melodie  we have flood plans which are setup very fast in case of need
00:26 melodie  all the mairies and mayors have a hierarchy and instructions from the prefet in case of need
00:27 melodie  Mayors* Prefets*
00:27 melodie  pdurbin are there around Boston?
00:33 melodie  bb in a few minutes
00:50 melodie  pdurbin I have never had to face a tornadoe and never heard of any happening in France.
00:50 melodie  does it happen each year in the central states in US?
00:52 pdurbin  I grew up in Ohio, a central state, at we had tornado drills several times a year in school. we practiced hiding in the basement. I think the system to alert people is difficult to implement or it would have been done already
00:55 melodie  pdurbin drills are always useful
00:55 melodie  Ohio is far from Kansas and Oklahoma, less center
00:55 melodie  less centered
00:55 melodie  are there as many tornadoes there?
00:56 pdurbin  maybe not as many. we call Ohio part of the "Midwest." if you look at a map... it's not very west... :)
00:57 melodie  http://lycee-alienor.fr/histoire-geo/expose/tornades.htm
00:57 melodie  this pages says the USA is the country with the biggest frequency of tornadoes
00:58 melodie  entre 700 et 1200 tornades par an. // 700 to 1200 per year? :o
01:03 melodie  pdurbin this page says the tornadoes are the most dangerous in the Middle West States
01:08 pdurbin  sounds about right
01:18 melodie  I had a very interesting discussion at #linuxchix chan, with women who have lots of experience in life, and where I was trying to state that forests would do lots of good to all the territories where some catastrophic events due to nature happens, they have done their best to prove me I am wrong, because the nature has provided the earth as is in center of US and many places: steppes, prairies...
01:18 melodie  I was almost convinced that for some reason difficult for me to understand, the nature there wanted only grass growing
01:19 melodie  but I just found some writings which might bring another sight to the problem
01:19 melodie  http://history1800s.about.com/od/americanoriginals/a/GeorgePerkinsMarshbio.htm
01:19 melodie  I have two texts in French there:
01:19 melodie  http://www.cairn.info/revue-ecologie-et-politique-2008-1-page-155.htm
01:19 melodie  first part, and second part, translated from the original book in English
01:20 melodie  http://www.cairn.info/revue-ecologie-et-politique-2008-2-page-155.htm
01:20 melodie  I will read it carefully in the following days, and try to write a post about it
01:23 ben_e    there are alerts when tornadoes are likely and when they know for sure they have formed and can be seen on radar
01:23 ben_e    you buy little $10 weather alert radios if you live in places that have tornadoes regularly
01:24 ben_e    all the tv stations and radio stations will switch to emergency broadcasts
01:24 ben_e    and in downtowns and metro areas they usually have some form of air raid siren that they use in imminent tornado events
01:25 ben_e    for the oklahoma thing they actually had a 16 minute warning before the tornado hit
01:27 melodie  I read a page a few minutes ago where it is explained that the tornadoes can happen brutally without the systems of detection able to know long enough before, so the article said it's really reliable at 90% : which is about the same for most natural issues (flood and storms as well)
01:28 melodie  in this page: http://history1800s.about.com/od/americanoriginals/a/GeorgePerkinsMarshbio.htm there is a link to his book : "man and nature" - http://books.google.fr/books?id=q-7wEQi0Gj0C&dq=&redir_esc=y
01:28 melodie  that seems to be a very interesting piece of history

23:58 pdurbin  somehow, for me, YAML and JSON are *always* on topic :)
