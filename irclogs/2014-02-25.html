16:54 semiosis gitlab has a "project wall" message board, tho I haven't used that feature yet
17:03 pdurbin  hmm
17:04 semiosis gitlab self-hosted on gitlab: https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/
17:08 pdurbin  is that the wall? looks more like commits
17:10 semiosis thats the project homepage, which is a combined view of several sections.  wall is not enabled for this project
17:11 semiosis it would be a tab at the top
17:11 pdurbin  oh
17:11 pdurbin  is the wall awesome?
17:11 semiosis gitlab is super awesome
17:17 pdurbin  ok
17:34 semiosis just tried the wall.  i wouldn't say it's awesome, but it does look useful
17:35 semiosis it's a pretty new feature though
17:52 joshu    semiosis IIRC you use znc?
18:23 pdurbin  semiosis: can we see the wall?

18:58 semiosis joshu: yes, znc

19:03 pdurbin  hmm
19:03 pdurbin  I'm a little underwhelmed ;)
19:03 semiosis like i said, it's a new feature
19:06 semiosis wow ##javaee really turned ugly today
19:07 semiosis going to take a break from that channel for a day or two
19:07 semiosis people fighting like little kids calling names in the schoolyard
20:04 joshu    semiosis how are you hosting it? I'm thinking about setting it up as I want the freedom to close my irc client and not lose ongoing discussions
20:09 melodie  hello!
20:21 semiosis hi melodie
20:21 semiosis joshu: i have an ec2 micro instance i use for znc, logstashbot, and openvpn (for when i'm on public wifi)
20:22 joshu    semiosis is znc hard to setup and configure?
20:22 semiosis not in my opinion :)
20:23 semiosis i installed the package from ubuntu.  i recommend version 1 or later, which you can get in ubuntu saucy by default, and in precise by enabling the backports repo
20:23 semiosis iirc the configuration was all done through znc's built in web control panel
20:25 joshu    ok I'll do some googling tonight and set one up too ;)
