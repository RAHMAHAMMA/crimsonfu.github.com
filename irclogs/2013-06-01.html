12:06 pdurbin JoeJulian: isn't 0mq getting rewritten a third time? C++ to C to a new architecture
13:06 pdurbin hmm, there's http://nanomsg.org and http://www.crossroads.io ... both mentioned at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ZeroMQ
13:07 pdurbin all I know is that at least some of the original developers decided C++ was a poor choice afterall and wrote a newer version of something similar in C
