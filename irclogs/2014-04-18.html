00:01 pdurbin    yes
00:01 pdurbin    very
00:01 pdurbin    slowly
13:48 codex      pdurbin: thanks :)
13:52 pdurbin    codex: you gonna give dotplus a link?
13:55 codex      I need some more info about dotplus
13:55 larsks     I've been hosting a few instances on digitalocean.com and I've been happy.  Hard to beat $5/month.
13:55 codex      since this is more of a "private" host
13:56 codex      digitalocean *is* very good. The issue is the $5/month is super underspced for real stuff
13:56 larsks     They do have other options :)
13:56 codex      but it's great for testing/prototyping -- especially since you can get it by the hour
13:56 codex      larsks: yea, but the price point on those other options is not as good as the $5/deal
13:56 codex      prgmr.com is interesting - but west coast based, and only xen
13:57 codex      larsks: btw, digital ocean - one of hte biggest annoyances, they restrict kernels
13:57 codex      so you can't actually upgrade to the latest kernel without them approving it, and they are a whole bunch of kernels behind  ...constantly
13:57 larsks     codex: Yeah, and in general restrict you to their selection of disk images.
13:57 codex      :nod:
13:58 codex      I started a shared hosting/vps/docker host which is "by geeks for geeks"
13:58 codex      but i am trying to keep it mostly to people I know/people that are in some way refered
13:58 codex      it makes things easier this way
13:58 codex      uptime so far has been fantastic, as pdurbin can comment on
14:11 pdurbin    +1
14:35 dotplus    codex: I'm not too open in logged fora about who I am, although I don't try too hard to hide:) http://www.allgoodbits.org. started as a unix sysadmin @cmu.edu now @ornl.gov, involved with lopsa.org and usenix.org
14:37 westmaas   codex: what's your docker hosting service like? just curious about implementation :)
14:38 * westmaas has his last day at rackspace today
14:48 dotplus    westmaas: really? got something else fun in the works?
15:00 pdurbin    westmaas: do tell!
15:00 pdurbin    comptona: who you gonna ask openstack questions of now?
15:03 pdurbin    mhayden: that might make you the last racker here
15:50 pdurbin    my interview on Hacker Public Radio was published! https://soundcloud.com/philipdurbin/dataverse-on-hacker-public-radio-1490
15:51 pdurbin    I talk about Dataverse, Vagrant, Docker, Shibboleth, and building communities
16:20 * pdurbin  dreams about a Dataverse package for Debian: http://irclog.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/2014-04-18#i_8516
18:23 codex      westmaas: this is a lunch type of conversation
18:23 codex      (how i have docker setup)
18:23 codex      and it's still heavily beta, but it seems to work very well
18:45 westmaas   pdurbin: headed to crowdtilt
18:45 westmaas   with mr ironcamel and magoo when he is in here
18:46 westmaas   codex: don't suppose you are in the bay area?
18:46 westmaas   dotplus: oh you asked first :)
18:46 westmaas   dotplus: headed to crowdtilt
18:47 ironcamel  yay westmaas!
18:47 ironcamel  westmaas: when are you moving to SF?
18:48 westmaas   leaving in ...3 hours
