12:57 hydrajump codex hi I'm looking at whether to use AWS vs a docker purpose built provider. Do you have any experience with any of the providers listed here http://www.centurylinklabs.com/top-10-startups-built-on-docker/ or any others not listed?
19:50 codex     hydrajump: very different use cases
19:50 codex     aws -> full blown VM/stack
19:50 codex     for special apps/webapps or "modules" if you will, i would build purpose specific docker containers
19:50 codex     you should always have some full VM somewhere -- at least at this time (imo)
19:51 codex     digitalocean is a great provider with ssd that's cheap
20:02 hydrajump so the docker hosting providers where you don't have access to the host VM aren't yet ready for prime time?
20:04 hydrajump If I'm not clear what I'm comparing is say an AWS instance of ubuntu server which you setup/config plus docker and then your containers versus a docker hosting providers such as dotcloud or tatum where you only deal with the docker containers
22:04 pdurbin   it's a good question
