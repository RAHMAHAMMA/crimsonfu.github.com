01:10 pdurbin      semiosis: from which to which?
01:10 semiosis     from angularjs (pure javascript) to zend framework2 (pure php)
01:11 pdurbin      sounds so... 90s
01:11 semiosis     building our corporate web site in angular was a mistake.  search engines can't crawl it because they don't execute javascript like browsers do
01:11 pdurbin      we should have stopped you. sorry
01:11 semiosis     lol
01:12 pdurbin      I didn't realize quite what you were up to
01:13 semiosis     <3 php & zf2
01:14 pdurbin      I've heard of Zend
01:15 pdurbin      is the "2" significant? new hotness?
01:15 semiosis     completely & totally
01:15 pdurbin      ok
01:16 semiosis     since the site was just a bunch of templates filling in data from json files it was very easy to convert... s/{{variable}}/<?= variable ?>/ basically
01:17 semiosis     that sort of thing is the same in any framework
01:17 pdurbin      right. cool
01:17 semiosis     now the search engines can see the site :)
01:18 pdurbin      :)
01:18 pdurbin      oh hey, "I can give you a free LXC on my system" -- https://botbot.me/freenode/positivepython/msg/5937522/
01:19 semiosis     hahaha
01:20 pdurbin      :)
01:20 semiosis     for some definitions of "you"

17:36 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky linux dmenu
17:36 crimsonfubot pdurbin: https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Dmenu
17:36 pdurbin      sagotsky: that must be it. (nice bumping into you)
17:37 sagotsky     correct
17:37 sagotsky     you too
17:37 pdurbin      sagotsky: what do you use it for again?
17:37 sagotsky     the basic use is as a launcher
17:38 sagotsky     but I've got a handful of scripts using it.  it lets you quickly select one item from a list.
17:39 pdurbin      Right, right. I'll have to try it at home from my Linux box. I'm on a Mac at the moment.
17:40 sagotsky     I have scripts for selecting songs from ~/music, sshing into servers in .ssh/config, displaying cheat sheets.  I also have a launcher that instead of giving you all the options in your path, reads from xdg menu.  I like that one because I can't always remember distro specific configuration programs.
19:21 pdurbin      fancy
19:28 pdurbin      huh. "I'm on Lync more than Gtalk"
