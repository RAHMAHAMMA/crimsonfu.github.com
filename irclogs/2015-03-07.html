13:49 prologic So I've created a new Linux Distro / OS
13:49 prologic it's still early but the prototype works quite nicely in qemu so far
13:49 prologic Need a good name for it though :)
13:50 pdurbin  crux!
13:50 prologic lol
13:50 prologic taken :)
13:50 pdurbin  d'oh!
13:51 prologic ideas welcome
13:51 prologic https://github.com/therealprologic/pos
13:51 prologic temporary codename :)
13:52 pdurbin  so it's busybox with some stuff on top
13:53 prologic sure
13:54 prologic if that's the way you want to think of it :)
13:54 prologic I'm still weighing up options for a package manager
13:54 prologic but I may have to write my own
13:54 prologic Slackware's is pretty close to what I need/want
13:54 prologic But the general idea here is that the core system is quite minimal
13:54 prologic when you install what you need via packages
13:55 prologic And we're going with finit as our init
13:59 pdurbin  we?
14:01 prologic 2 on the project so far
14:01 prologic tentative 2 others :)
14:02 pdurbin  ah
