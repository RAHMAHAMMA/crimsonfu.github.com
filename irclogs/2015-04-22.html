14:55 pdurbin   I'm having the weirdest problem with Vagrant. I can access forwarded ports in a browser but not from curl.
14:56 pdurbin   curl 'http://localhost:8993/solr/collection1/select?q=*&wt=json&indent=true'
14:56 pdurbin   curl: (7) Failed to connect to localhost port 8993: Connection refused
14:56 pdurbin   config.vm.network "forwarded_port", guest: 8983, host: 8993
14:58 pdurbin   huh, but if I replace "localhost" with "127.0.0.1" it works from curl
