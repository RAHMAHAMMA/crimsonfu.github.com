18:49 semiosis  well, it's about time!  PHBs have been asking for a gluster GUI for ages!
18:50 semiosis  coincidentally someone was just asking about a GUI in #gluster moments ago
18:50 semiosis  so I passed that release notes link along, thanks!
18:51 pdurbin   semiosis: sure. i see some links about ovirt already in #gluster today: http://www.gluster.org/interact/log-details/?log=2012-08
18:52 semiosis  cool
18:56 pdurbin   semiosis: oh wait, not today.  huh, the whole month of irc logs on one page... and no permalinks per line...
18:57 semiosis  !!!!!!!
18:58 semiosis  makes loading those pages on a phone/tablet an exercise in frustration
18:58 pdurbin   semiosis: consider using the bot we use: http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot
18:59 pdurbin   though we don't run it... blog | Perlgeek.de :: An offer for software developers: free IRC logging - http://perlgeek.de/blog-en/perl-6/an-offer-to-the-perl-community.html

19:09 pdurbin   note to self: screengrab ( https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/screengrab/ ) is super useful for capturing screenshots of webpages all the way down past what you can see but i think i have this installed to make it work with newer versions of firefox: NightlyTesterTools https://wiki.mozilla.org/QA/Automation_Services/Projects/Addons/NightlyTesterTools
19:25 JoeJulian Wow... this is pretty cool: http://www.referencearchitecture.org/
