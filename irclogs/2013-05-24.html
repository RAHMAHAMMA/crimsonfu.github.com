14:27 semiosis  seeing a pattern of support requests in irc
14:27 semiosis  someone turns up & says they have the same problem as somebody wrote about in a blog post
14:28 semiosis  then goes on to say the solution in the blog post doesnt work, or that their setup is very different
14:28 JoeJulian hehe
14:28 semiosis  you know what i'm talking about
14:29 JoeJulian You bet I do.
14:29 pdurbin   so people should stop blogging? ;)
14:30 JoeJulian Maybe I should add a disclaimer to each of my blog posts, "If you're experiencing a problem that this doesn't solve, you have a different problem. Please don't reference this page when asking for help with your different problem."
14:46 semiosis  pdurbin: i would rather have people contributing fixes upstream than writing a blog post with their lame hack
14:46 semiosis  few blogs are worthwhile, the rest should stop yes
14:46 semiosis  :)
14:47 pdurbin   people definitely shouldn't make noise in publicly logged irc channels
14:48 JoeJulian Otoh, I'm not sufficiently practiced in C to contribute. I file bugs, yes, but if the devs don't find them interesting or worthy of fixing, then a blog post is the best I can do.
14:49 pdurbin   JoeJulian: did you ever listen to https://soundcloud.com/philipdurbin/theodore-tso-on-gluster-ext4 ? I find it fascinating
14:51 JoeJulian I had not.
14:58 semiosis  pdurbin: point taken :)
15:29 JoeJulian I just try to make it a point of never saying something, logged or otherwise, that I wouldn't say to someone's face.
15:30 JoeJulian Which includes my little rant yesterday. :)
15:35 pdurbin   :)
22:36 pdurbin   huh. an email from http://averagesecurityguy.info telling me about passwords in a github repo. he seems to be on github himself: https://github.com/averagesecurityguy
22:37 pdurbin   semiosis: I don't know that I had a point. I'm the noisiest one :)
22:48 ben_e     yeah, i read it as tongue in cheek
22:48 ben_e     but i've sat across the table from phil while he engaged in self-deprecation, so i have a sense that he doesn't take himself too seriously
