15:01 boegel       pdurbin: that doesn't seem so surprising, Python is really rooted into RH-based systems

16:12 pdurbin      31m20.213s to migrate a 25 GB disk image
16:12 pdurbin      i've been estimating roughly one minute per gigabyte but i guess that's somewhat optimistic
16:19 pdurbin      ventz: yes, i'm sticking with qcow2 :)
16:42 * dotplus    happily sends a pull request for puppetlabs-mysql to support using mysql packages from IUScommunity.org

17:33 dotplus      pdurbin: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetlabs-mysql/pull/121
17:39 pdurbin      dotplus: watching! thanks. :)
17:43 dotplus      unfortunately if you look at the commentary on the previous incarnation /120, it seems that the maintainer doesn't want to include support for alternate sources, only for different package names which nixes IUS. Well, I solved his other concerns and tried to explain why the existing functionality that he's so fond of is insufficient , so we'll see how it goes now.
17:43 dotplus      I'd rather not maintain my own fork:)
17:44 pdurbin      perish the thought
