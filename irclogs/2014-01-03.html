04:54 pdurbin      lilypond is just awesome: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2014-01-03#i_8064841
14:40 dotplus      yup, I've used lilypond to make my own arrangements of a few things and to have preprinted transpositions so that I don't have to transpose on the fly (as a violinist, I'm not really as used to that as folks who play, say, clarinets or trumpets)
14:42 dotplus      takes a little getting used to, was not always straightforward to get exactly the notation I wanted. But I suspect that's more my lack of familiarity
14:46 dotplus      frescobaldi.org made it easier for me to ensure that where I was in the source was actually where I wanted to be in the score/output.
14:56 dotplus      oh also, projectabjad.org if you want to manage larger works
15:07 pdurbin      dotplus: thanks... just to make these clickable in the logs:
15:07 pdurbin      Frescobaldi: Edit LilyPond sheet music with ease! - http://frescobaldi.org
15:07 pdurbin      Abjad is a Python API for formalize score control and music notation. - http://projectabjad.org
15:07 pdurbin      also...
15:07 pdurbin      this is awesome: The Mutopia Project: Free sheet music for everyone http://www.mutopiaproject.org
15:08 pdurbin      now on github: https://github.com/chrissawer/The-Mutopia-Project
15:09 pdurbin      it blows my minds that I can download a lilypond file here: Maple Leaf Rag, by S. Joplin (1868â€“1917) - http://www.mutopiaproject.org/cgibin/piece-info.cgi?id=23 ... and then get an awesome pdf and midi with only: lilypond maple.ly && xdg-open maple.pdf && timidity maple.midi
15:11 dotplus      ok, next time I'll try to remember the http:// to make-clicky. yeah, I peeked at mutopia too. looks like fun.
15:13 dotplus      Last year I had access to a cello for a while, which was awesome, but very weird for a violinist (their strings are so heavy in comparison!), and I'd also like to learn something polyphonic (keyboard/guitar) so that I can play harmonic as well, but given that I have a new kid that might have to wait
15:14 dotplus      s/might/will/
15:20 pdurbin      dotplus: congrats!
15:22 pdurbin      I'm very much a newbie when it comes to music. I took a guitar class in college, a piano class about 8 years ago and a music theory class about 6 years ago
15:22 pdurbin      my 7 year old is taking her first piano lessons and I'm making sheet music to help reinforce what's she's learning
15:24 pdurbin      I have half a mind to start a new website for sheet music for people just starting to learn music. And maybe other resources
15:25 pdurbin      the thing I like about lilypond is that I can create music that I'm not skilled enough to play (yet)... I can get it to sound better than my ability to play it... which gives me something to work toward... something to practice
15:26 pdurbin      I'm reminded that I favorited this the other day: http://music.stackexchange.com/questions/4904/how-do-i-make-piano-chords-sound-interesting-when-playing-along-with-popular-songs
15:39 dotplus      I wanted to learn piano along with kid #1, but she really disliked it so stopped before I got a chance to join in (she moved on to djembe for which she seems to have a talent)
15:53 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky djembe
15:53 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Djembe
15:54 pdurbin      I have a picture of my youngest playing the drums when she can barely sit. We just bought her a ukulele for xmas
