10:50 pdurbin   I'm always disinclined to click on PDFs.
11:21 hydrajump pdurbin: why worried that they are malicious?
11:22 pdurbin   no, I just prefer a light HTML landing page for PDFs
11:23 pdurbin   a PDF is the end of the road. you're off the web
11:28 pdurbin   oh, I see, there are no HTML landing pages per PDF: http://www.rsaconference.com/events/us15/downloads-and-media?keywords=&track=&type=presentations
