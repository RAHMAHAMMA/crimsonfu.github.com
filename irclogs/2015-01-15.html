14:28 pdurbin   if anyone would like to come to lunch on Tuesday with me and a founder of http://openhatch.org please let me know. codex larsks tfhartmann
15:09 pdurbin   and a very cool person who works there: http://irclogs.jackgrigg.com/irc.freenode.net/openhatch/2015-01-15#i_3546403
17:22 semiosis  ejabberd is great but so frustrating.  ubuntu packages dont support mysql, but they run at boot.  upstream install includes mysql support, but won't start at boot.  argggh
17:35 pdurbin   is the e for erlang?
17:35 pdurbin   whorka: I can't believe you'd never heard of https://twitter.com/php_ceo
17:40 semiosis  yes
17:40 semiosis  the e is for erlang
17:40 semiosis  and for extremely frustrating
17:43 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky mostly erlang
17:43 searchbot pdurbin: http://mostlyerlang.com/
17:44 pdurbin   they have a nice podcast though
17:49 pdurbin   let it crash
17:54 bear      if your using ejabberd I would recommend prosody instead
17:55 semiosis  i'm ready to throw this thing out the window
17:55 semiosis  finally get the db working and now some obscure bug prevents login
17:55 semiosis  people saying they had to compile latest erlang from source to get past it
17:55 semiosis  wtaf
17:56 semiosis  bear: all i need is TLS encryption and server-managed shared buddy list.  this is a private chat server for our small company, everyone is on a single buddy list
17:56 bear      yea, that's why I prefer prosody - it tracks the latest xmpp requirements, uses lua which is a much saner language to debug/work with and is very stable
17:56 semiosis  bear: can prosody do that?
17:56 bear      yep
17:56 semiosis  thanks!
17:57 bear      stock prosody from the debian/ubuntu package will get you that
17:57 semiosis  oh another thing i need, no local storage
17:57 pdurbin   semiosis: you know bear is on some XMPP board, right?
17:57 bear      you can use sqlite, mysql, flat file, ... all in the config
17:57 semiosis  this is running on a transient ec2 instance
17:57 semiosis  woooo!
17:57 semiosis  my hero
17:57 semiosis  pdurbin: did not know that
17:57 bear      http://prosody.im/doc/mysql
17:58 bear      last year I was the chairman of the XSF Board
17:58 bear      this year I took a break :)
17:58 semiosis  nice
18:02 semiosis  and prosody has their own upstream apt repo! \o/
18:03 semiosis  glad i decided to complain in here :)
18:04 pdurbin   that's what #crimsonfu is for
18:04 dotplus   bear: do you happen to whether hipchat/slack/whatever the cisco thing is called are built on top of prosody/ejabberd/something opensource or whether they each have their own thing?
18:04 * pdurbin high fives tfhartmann
18:05 bear      yea, cisco's chat service uses xmpp on the backed IIRC
18:05 bear      the original "Jabber" team got bought by cisco way back
18:06 bear      webex and it's variants
18:06 dotplus   They all use XMPP, I was wondering if you knew about the whether server implementations were prosody/ejabberd/whatever
18:07 bear      I haven't looked that deep
18:08 dotplus   no worries, just curious and it sounded like you might be more likely to know than a quick stfw might reveal
18:10 bear      you can always point xmpp.net at the domain - it will spit out what it discovers
18:17 dotplus   interesting, but that only appears to look at security aspects dns, tls protocols/ciphers, not server software.
18:19 bear      hmm, I thought it reported server signatures...
18:21 bear      ah - they have s2s blocked for it - so server guessing is blocked
18:33 semiosis  sadly the groups feature in prosody doesnt store in the db, and afaict from the docs there's no wildcard... i would have to edit the config file every time we add/remove a user
18:33 semiosis  bear: does that sound right?
18:33 semiosis  or am i missing something
18:34 bear      yea, I think your missing something
18:34 bear      group - do you mean a group of users?
18:34 semiosis  http://prosody.im/doc/modules/mod_groups
18:35 semiosis  says i have to explicitly list the usernames
18:35 bear      ah
18:35 semiosis  but i just want one group with all users
18:35 bear      let me ask if they have that set so you can use a bot to configure...
18:36 semiosis  thx
18:41 semiosis  maybe i'll submit a patch to add that feature :)
18:41 bear      :)
18:42 semiosis  i can live with this text file config for now
18:42 bear      the prosody devs are all in europe, so getting an answer can be slow
18:42 semiosis  deploying a new server image when someone joins/leaves the company isn't *that* big of a deal
18:42 bear      they are a friendly lot - you can jump on their chat room and ask anything
18:42 semiosis  i'm sure i will
18:42 bear      you could probably update the config and then just use prosodyctl command to bounce the group module
18:43 bear      it would be a -HUP type config update
18:43 semiosis  this is an immutable server image
18:43 bear      oof
18:43 bear      so yea, a patch to get it to use a data store instead of a flatfile would be most welcome
18:47 semiosis  i was thinking a patch to support a wildcard term for all registered users
18:47 semiosis  and still using flatfile
18:48 semiosis  that seems like an easier patch to start with
18:48 bear      ah - yea
19:10 dotplus   semiosis: won't your CM take care of that for you? or are you trying to avoid bouncing the service every time you want to add a user or something like that?
19:22 GWG       I need some server advice of a different nature
19:23 GWG       My server at home has ded
19:23 GWG       died
19:24 GWG       Trying to decide if I should go RAID 5
19:26 bear      in some ways the raid question is how much the drives cost vs how long you can afford to be offline
19:27 bear      if you don't mind being offline, then raid 2 (mirroring) is doable, if you don't want to be offline then raid 5 is an option
19:27 dotplus   think about what you're trying to achieve. Is your data (easily) recreatable? Will you cry if it's gone? Are you going to setup monitoring (and act on any alerts!) to show when a disk goes bad? what kind of usage do you expect?
19:28 semiosis  dotplus: cm only runs to build the image, once it's deployed to the cluster it's immutable
19:28 dotplus   bear: raid2 is striping, raid 1 is mirroring
19:28 semiosis  cluster of one in this case, autoscaling just makes sure there's one alive
19:28 bear      dotplus - ah, thanks - i'm always getting that wrong
19:29 semiosis  might scrap the whole IM server thing and signup for one of those SaaS products pdurbin mentioned
19:29 semiosis  more trouble than it's worth
19:30 dotplus   eh, I would think that for a small outfit who are already comfortable managing stuff, it's easy enough to add one more simple service
19:30 GWG       I thought it was 0 and 1
19:30 dotplus   but otoh, there's always the "focus on your core competencies" against that
19:30 GWG       But, I've only had rare hard drive failures
19:30 GWG       I just had a motherboard failure
19:31 dotplus   raid Z
19:32 pdurbin   that I mentioned?
19:33 semiosis  [13:04] <dotplus> bear: do you happen to whether hipchat/slack/whatever the cisco thing is called are built on top of prosody/ejabberd/something opensource or whether they each have their own thing?
19:33 semiosis  that definitely not pdurbin saying that
19:33 semiosis  brain not working on account of cold or flu
19:33 pdurbin   I think my wife's startup is using slack.
19:33 bear      slack is good, but heck, you could also just go with one of the new hosted irc's
19:34 semiosis  that's not going to work for us. 80% of the company is not devs
19:34 semiosis  90%?
19:35 bear      slack works well then - desktop clients, mobile clents - very very non-dev friendly
19:36 bear      or you can use something like gitter-im - and tie it to a private repo
19:36 pdurbin   wife approval factor
19:40 dotplus   Also very non-dev friendly: http://www.webex.com/projectsquared/ (Disclaimer: I work for Cisco which owns webex)
19:40 dotplus   just not for that bit of Cisco. or indeed anywhere near it.
19:42 semiosis  wow there sure are a lot of choices
19:43 dotplus   hire me as a consultant and I will research your needs, the options, recommend something suitable and help you implement/make the most of it.
19:43 dotplus   actually, I'm kidding. I don't do that sort of thing any more.
19:43 semiosis  lol
19:54 semiosis  project squared doesn't even have pricing info
19:54 semiosis  scary
20:05 semiosis  hipchat has a native linux client.  SOLD!
21:27 pdurbin   man, whatever happend to http://crimsonfu.github.io/members/agoddard
21:27 pdurbin   that guy was great
21:35 pdurbin   and shuff. I remember shuff
21:36 pdurbin   shuff and whorka: please prepare a warm welcome
22:00 whorka    warming the phasers
22:08 pdurbin   heh. stun is fine
22:22 shuff     hey, prosody!  i love it
