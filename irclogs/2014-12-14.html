02:52 pdurbin    oh, I thought you were kidding that that's a thing :)
07:01 Guest26971 pdurbin, no quite serious
07:01 Guest26971 there is such a project
07:01 Guest26971 gopherproject.org
07:01 Guest26971 #gopherproject
13:12 pdurbin    I know this site somehow.
13:12 pdurbin    ah yes, because for a while I used this: TTYtter: an interactive console text-based command-line Twitter client and Perl platform (whew!) - http://www.floodgap.com/software/ttytter/
15:28 prologic   Oh guess what?
15:28 prologic   http://www.pythondiary.com/blog/Dec.12,2014/building-gopher-client-django.html
15:28 prologic   http://www.pythondiary.com/blog/Dec.13,2014/planet-python-now-available-gopher.html
15:35 pdurbin    "Have you ever wanted to enable your users to access your Gopher server without the need of them installing a browser plugin, installing a standalone software, or using a third part proxy service?"
15:35 pdurbin    ... can't say that I have
15:36 pdurbin    tychoish: oh, I was singing ikiwiki's praises yesterday
16:27 pdurbin    prologic: crux: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2014-12-14#i_9804534
16:28 prologic   ahh nice
16:36 henson     Setting up public server for first time on an old machine. I've disabled root ssh login (and password login), and installed fail2ban. I've got postfix, ssh, and apache exposed publicly. Any other recommendations?
16:37 prologic   swap out postfix for esmtp and relay via gmail
16:37 prologic   swap out apache for lighttpd or nginx
16:37 pdurbin    henson: welcome! so you're new to rpm distros: https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-14#t1418574774491
16:37 pdurbin    mhayden: henson seems to be getting into selinux, your favorite :)
16:37 prologic   install docker, learn it, use it :)
16:38 prologic   my 2c worth :)
16:38 henson     prologic: So you're running your webservices out of docker? Do you make seperate docker files for each service?
16:38 prologic   I'll be building a new server soon on hetzner.de
16:38 prologic   moving away from my physical at codero.com
16:38 prologic   henson, I do yes
16:38 pdurbin    henson: I assume you don't allow relaying with postfix, that it's relatively locked down
16:39 prologic   henson, also setup gopher :)
16:39 henson     pdurbin: Yeah, just single server, no relay.
16:39 henson     prologic: Hahaha, that's awesome. I've only read about it old books ;-)
16:39 henson     prologic: I'm still reading mail from terminal though. Have any imap suggestions?
16:40 pdurbin    prologic has been on a gopher kick for 3 days
16:40 prologic   gopher://arrow.shortcircuit.net.au is my Gopherspace for now :)
16:41 prologic   imap client?
16:41 prologic   mutt
16:41 henson     Oh, no, sorry. IMAP server
16:42 pdurbin    dovecot is probably the default IMAP server on Fedora. I've used Cyrus in the past
16:42 prologic   oh
16:42 prologic   dovecot
16:43 prologic   yeah cyrus or dovecot
16:43 prologic   but again I do recommend getting into Docker :)
16:43 prologic   and Dockerizing everything
16:43 prologic   it'll save you many painful hours later on when you have to figure out how the hell you configured things :)
16:44 pdurbin    prologic: have you used Puppet, Chef, Ansible, Salt, etc?
16:45 henson     pdurbin: Ooh! I'm interested in that as well. Not sure which one to pick. I know was popular choice in the past
16:48 pdurbin    I have the most experience with Puppet but I'm 2 years out of date. Some experience with Salt. Not sure what to recommend. Honestly, I've switched to little shell scripts in Vagrant for now until I decide. :)
16:50 pdurbin    henson: here's my server config captured in Puppet configs: https://github.com/pdurbin/greptilian-vagrant
16:52 pdurbin    prologic: that's how I remember what I did :)
16:55 henson     pdurbin: that's a great idea. installing git now
16:57 pdurbin    I assume people use Puppet, Chef, etc. with Docker but I don't know.
17:10 henson     Last question.. ;-)    Favorite Linux IRC client?
17:10 pdurbin    weechat!
18:16 pdurbin    GWG: welcome! heh. "server administration tax" https://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-12-14#t1418580742718 :)
18:18 GWG        I was hosting a site for someone ob my server. I just evicted them. They took my load from averaging 0.7 to peaking at 75
18:18 GWG        They would not take my advice on what not to do
18:19 GWG        So, I built myself a new server and left.
18:19 GWG        Then told them that they could move or transfer the old one to their names
18:20 GWG        I still have a bunch of things I need to build/rebuild. Like better monitoring
18:22 GWG        When pdurbin mentioned this place, I thought I might learn some things or get ideas lurking
18:31 pdurbin    GWG: not sure what kind of monitoring you're looking for but this was easy to install: http://munin.greptilian.com
18:43 bear       I've also used monit for small server counts - http://mmonit.com/monit/
18:43 GWG        I use monit and collectd, actually
18:43 GWG        I didn't find Munin suited me
18:44 GWG        So, this time around, I focused on thinking through my alert conditions much more thoroughly.
18:44 GWG        So I wouldn't get a flood of useless info and miss the useful info
18:44 GWG        That's my monitoring issue right now
18:45 GWG        How to decide what I need to know
18:45 bear       yep - that's the hard part of monitoring
18:45 bear       you only know that by setting a value for a threshold, waiting for the alert and then deciding if it was too soon or too late :)
18:45 bear       because each server environment is different
18:46 bear       80% drive full warning seems ok unless your app creates 15% space during peak and you run out of disk because of a surge
18:46 bear       things like that
18:46 GWG        I learned a lot when those people killed my server
18:47 bear       doing a post-mortem after *all* server outages is the only way to learn
18:49 GWG        Then there is collectd, which is graph based monitoring.
18:49 GWG        I had a lot of pretty graphs
18:49 bear       that is more accurately called metrics
18:49 GWG        I felt I didn't take advantage of them
18:50 pdurbin    bear: have you tried https://github.com/mperham/inspeqtor ? It's new and inspired by monit. I heard about it at http://thechangelog.com/130/
18:51 bear       inspeqtor looks good - seems to be more for small server setups ... ah, ruby Sidekiq authors... now I get the q in the name :)
18:53 pdurbin    semiosis: too bad I missed you when you were in town for http://monitorama.com
18:56 pdurbin    this is a new open source montoring system: http://blog.serverfault.com/2014/11/10/announcing-bosun/
19:04 pdurbin    I run my IRC client on my only server so I usually find out pretty quickly when it's down. No need for alerts. :)
20:42 prologic   pdurbin, Puppet and Ansaible
20:42 prologic   preference towards Ansiable
20:42 prologic   however these days
20:42 prologic   preference towards Immutable Infrastructure -- Docker
20:43 pdurbin    makes sense
20:43 GWG        I missed the questoin there
20:45 pdurbin    GWG: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2014-12-14#i_9804595
20:48 GWG        There's a log.
20:48 GWG        great
20:48 GWG        Bookmarking that
20:49 GWG        pdurbin: Wish someone had suggested that before I built a server...could save me if I ever have to move again
20:49 GWG        Note to self...research that
20:50 prologic   Yeah Docker ftw
20:50 prologic   seriously
20:52 GWG        I like this room...it makes me think of new things
20:52 GWG        Conversely...you are all giving me a lot of work
20:54 prologic   indeed :)
20:54 prologic   Also don't forget gopher :)
20:59 GWG        Gopher? Who uses Gopher still?
20:59 GWG        After that, I'll start up my news server
21:00 GWG        Wait, people still use those
21:00 prologic   Apparently quite a few folk do
21:00 prologic   myself included :)
21:00 prologic   gopher://arrow.shortcircuit.net.au
21:01 GWG        Interesting
21:01 GWG        I thought gopher was extinct
21:01 prologic   far from it
21:01 prologic   ~3.5M selectors indexed with over ~150 known Gopherspaces
21:01 GWG        Learn something new every day
21:03 prologic   I was surprised too
21:03 prologic   but honestly I'm glad
21:03 prologic   I think we could revitalize Gopher
21:03 prologic   and give it a new set of wheels :)
21:04 prologic   This guy Kevin from Python Diary is another such example
21:04 prologic   gopher://gopher.veroneau.net/1/
21:04 prologic   Also: gopher://gopher.veroneau.net/1/Feeds/Planet%20Python -- Planet Python Feeds
21:05 prologic   And: gopher://gopherpedia.com/1/ -- Interface to Wikipedia
21:05 prologic   Also I highly recommend Gophernicus as a server if you plan to setup your own Gopherspace
21:05 prologic   gopher://gophernicus.org
21:06 prologic   it's very modern, maintained, stable, secure and fast
21:21 GWG        Hmm...
21:59 pdurbin    GWG: suggested Puppet or similar?
22:05 GWG        I just haven't gotten to deployment
22:10 sivoais    has anyone tried CFEngine? I'm amazed that it supports Android deployment
22:11 sivoais    it looks like a solid piece of software
22:20 pdurbin    sivoais: I know a guy who used to swear by it and was excited about the rewrite for version 3
22:22 pdurbin    not sure what it would have to do with android dev though
22:22 sivoais    there seems to be a Scala-based frontend tool that uses it <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudder_(software)>
22:23 sivoais    pdurbin: I think it is for provisioning devices in enterprises where people have a company phone/tablet
22:23 sivoais    and those need to be locked down
22:24 pdurbin    ah. ok
22:25 sivoais    more info here <http://cfengine.com/company/blog-detail/untethered-cfengine-hitches-a-lift-on-android/>
22:34 * pdurbin  is glad he isn't in the business of locking down people's phones
