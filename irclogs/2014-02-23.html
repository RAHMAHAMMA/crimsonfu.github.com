18:03 joshu   hi anyone around
18:11 pdurbin joshu: what up
18:12 joshu   hey pdurbin got a sed problem. Thought I'd ask here as you guys probably have a solution ;)
18:12 joshu   hi I'm using sed to insert new lines in a file, but the last line "}" has a leading space that I don't want and I can't seem to get rid of it. Here's the code https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b21cd7000043e8048147
18:20 pdurbin joshu: what does "file" look like? can you add it to the gist?
18:22 joshu   pdurbin I solved it by changing this line https://gist.github.com/anonymous/b21cd7000043e8048147#file-gistfile1-txt-L6 to include the last bracket \   }\n}
18:41 pdurbin joshu: ok. great
