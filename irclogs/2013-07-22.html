00:02 pdurbin   of interest, perhaps: Philip Durbin - Google+ - Microsoft's stock lost $32 billion in value today. … - https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/SAq5ULicB37
12:59 pdurbin   pointing out 'A note about drive vibration: The drives vibrate too much if you leave them sitting as shown in the picture above, so we add an “anti-vibration sleeve” (essentially a rubber band) around the hard drive in between the red metal grid and the drives.' at http://blog.backblaze.com/2009/09/01/petabytes-on-a-budget-how-to-build-cheap-cloud-storage/ :)
14:11 ben_e_    http://youtu.be/tDacjrSCeq4 <- don't shout in the server room
16:01 pdurbin   mhayden: I saw a tweet from someone at Rackspace about free VMs for open soure projects
16:01 mhayden   yes yes
16:02 pdurbin   from this guy, I think: https://twitter.com/jessenoller
16:03 pdurbin   found it: "You want free @rackspace cloud accounts for your OSS project / community needs. We have it. Jesse.noller@rackspace.com " -- https://twitter.com/jessenoller/status/355757374906183680
17:57 pdurbin   for i in `ls *tiff`; do convert $i $i.jpg; done
17:57 * pdurbin wishes Grab on OS X didn't save files as .tiff
18:13 sjoeboo_  pdurbin: you can change that to png. can't remember where, but i know its there.
18:14 pdurbin   hmm
18:15 pdurbin   "Grab saves screenshots as files in TIFF format. If you want to use your screenshots on the web, in email, or in a word processor, you can use Preview to convert the TIFF files to other formats, such as JPEG or PNG." -- the help page
18:22 ben_e     you use a 3rd party app for screenshots?
18:23 ben_e     comes with os x it seems
18:23 ben_e     i always just do the command+shift+# ones
18:24 ben_e     defaults write com.apple.screencapture type [bmp|pdf|jpg|tif|png|etc|rtfm]
18:33 sjoeboo_  yeah, didn't realize you were using some 3rd party tool....built is is good enough for me.
18:37 ben_e     apparently grab is in /apps/utilities and is provided by apple
18:37 ben_e     heh, case insensitive HFS+
18:37 ben_e     so /applications/utilities is actually correct
18:43 pdurbin   no... I'm not... I'm using Grab to create the tiff
18:43 pdurbin   and convert (from imagemagick) to convert it from tiff to jpg
18:45 semiosis  wow screencaps on a mac are that difficult?
18:45 pdurbin   ben_e: I should try your way. I don't know the shortcuts yet
18:57 pdurbin   right. so. click the window. then Cmd-Shift-4, then Space to bring up the camera icon. then click the window... and you get a PNG
18:59 pdurbin   via https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screenshot#Mac_OS_X
19:01 ben_e     i prefer pdfs for my screenshots
19:02 pdurbin   I need non-tiff to upload to Google Docs: SWORDv2 screenshots from Cottage Labs video - Google Drive - https://docs.google.com/a/g.harvard.edu/document/d/1oyz3ZTfZA_7FFNpZNaxR6cDJzLXgm3X1ybwUkMQwL1Q/edit
19:43 pdurbin   mhayden: I'm being told the VMs aren't free after all :(
