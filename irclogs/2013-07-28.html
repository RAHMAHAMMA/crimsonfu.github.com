01:47 ben_e_    dotplus: we are running mysql with a drbd+pacemaker backend
01:47 ben_e_    and failover works well
01:48 ben_e_    you can pull the plug on one of the servers and the website pretty much doesn't care
01:48 ben_e_    but we are not running a very high traffic site
01:49 ben_e_    ymmv, etc
12:11 pdurbin   mhayden: your kid would probably like this: http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/17/colar-uses-augmented-reality-to-brings-your-kids-drawing-to-life/
12:12 pdurbin   ironcamel: you too. my seven year old was blown away. as was I
12:13 pdurbin   ben_e_: today's the last day of their promotion to download it for free
12:15 pdurbin   ben_e_: glad to hear your HA MySQL solution works
12:16 * pdurbin looks at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LightDM
12:17 pdurbin   joshu: hmm, I haven't done much desktop development. I'm more of a back end guy
12:24 joshu     hi pdurbin ok now worries thanks
20:29 ironcamel pdurbin: very cool! I'm ... I mean my kids ... are going to love that
20:31 joshu     maybe this is not appropriate for here, but if i checkout a different git branch using git branch checkout -b 1.0.2 and I build that open source project using cmake, shouldn't the built product version be 1.0.2? I keep getting the version that's on master which is 1.1.0-beta1 :(
23:18 codex     anyone here interested in a nexus 7 for cheap?

23:51 pdurbin   ironcamel: glad you liked it :)
23:51 pdurbin   codex: are you buying the new version?
23:51 pdurbin   joshu: depends on how the build is set up
23:52 codex     pdurbin: i was thinking about it originally, but i am not sure. At the moment, since I have a work device too (note2), and a personal android, it seems like a bit too much
23:52 codex     i also have a HP touchpad running android
23:53 codex     so too many devices
