00:15 prologic    interesting :)
00:17 pdurbin     hydrajump and codex: please welcome prologic, a fellow docker user
00:17 pdurbin     larsks: and pythonista
00:18 pdurbin     creator of http://circuitsframework.com
00:18 prologic    Thanks pdurbin :)
00:19 pdurbin     prologic: so you sound pretty interested in dox: http://irclogs.shortcircuit.net.au/%23circuits/2014-11-14.log.html#t00:12:00
00:19 pdurbin     searchbot: lucky dox docker
00:19 searchbot   pdurbin: http://blog.chmouel.com/2014/09/08/dox-a-tool-that-run-python-or-others-tests-in-a-docker-container/
00:19 pdurbin     searchbot: lucky dox docker pypi
00:19 searchbot   pdurbin: https://pypi.python.org/pypi/dox/9f33ae5
00:21 prologic    hehe
00:21 * prologic  pats searchbot
00:21 prologic    nice bot :)
00:22 pdurbin     yeah. and ilbot3 does the logging but it isn't mine
00:22 prologic    *nods*
00:23 prologic    hmm
00:23 prologic    it's one of those things really
00:23 prologic    I could write my own CI
00:23 prologic    using circuits ofc
00:23 prologic    but do I have to? :)
00:24 pdurbin     we use jenkins at work
00:24 prologic    *nods*
00:24 prologic    I've used it before too
00:25 prologic    and built CRUX based Docker images for it
00:25 prologic    and had a whole setup that worked quite wel for circuits
00:25 prologic    but I haven't maintained it anywhere useful as such
00:25 prologic    mainly due to lack of infrastructure
00:25 prologic    but I may put it back up on DO maybe
00:25 prologic    or see how Drone's development pans out
00:25 prologic    thing is; neither Jenkins or Drone would suffice here
00:26 prologic    because CRUX's ports are in "collections"
00:26 prologic    so for example core, opt, xorg, contrib, etc
00:26 prologic    are collections of ports (each a repo)
00:27 prologic    so you can't just detect a change in that repo and run dox on it without elaborate commands in the dox.yml that try to work out what port(s) changed and rebuild those
00:36 pdurbin     prologic: sorry, I was staring at a Java stacktrace and wanted to send it off
00:38 prologic    hehe
00:38 pdurbin     searchbot: lucky crux port package
00:38 searchbot   pdurbin: http://crux.nu/Main/Handbook3-0
00:39 pdurbin     so this uses BSD ports, basically?
00:42 prologic    https://pypi.python.org/pypi/utmp
00:42 prologic    ^^^ cool :)
00:42 prologic    BSD ports?
00:42 prologic    yeah sort of
00:43 prologic    some of CRUX's inspiration probably came from *BSD
00:43 prologic    https://bitbucket.org/prologic/ports/
00:43 prologic    for a sample of my personal collection
00:43 prologic    Also if it wasn't obvious before
00:44 prologic    I want to do this for CRUX+Docker
00:44 prologic    So I maintain official images of CRUX in the Docker Official Library
00:44 prologic    namely "crux" versions 3.1 and 3.0
00:44 prologic    i.e: current and previous veriojn
00:45 prologic    my goal would be that crux/base (crux as the org and crux/base based on crux) adds pkg-get (our simple binary package manager and a default uri that points to where the CI publishes built packages)
00:50 pdurbin     wow. that's a lot of ports you maintain
00:51 pdurbin     what do you do for CI now?
00:51 prologic    oh we don't
00:52 prologic    we collectively as a community keep things tested and up-to-date
00:52 prologic    it's the testing and publishing part(s) I want to automate
00:53 * pdurbin   likes automation
00:53 prologic    Also you should checkout a new project
00:53 prologic    https://bitbucket.org/prologic/dcm
00:53 prologic    little side project I quickly wrote up 2 weekends ago
00:55 pdurbin     "dcm is a command-line tool to manage Docker' Hosts". cool
00:58 prologic    yeah
00:58 prologic    you can just do (for example):
00:59 prologic    dcm create
00:59 prologic    wait a minute or so
00:59 prologic    and it prints the ip address of the new node
01:00 prologic    the next couple of things I wanted to do are:
01:00 prologic    some way of easily using/connecting to these remote docker hosts/nodes
01:00 prologic    maybe a docker wrapper as such
01:00 prologic    or an easy way to export the "right env vars"
01:00 prologic    eval $(dcm env <node>)
01:01 prologic    could be pretty nice
01:01 prologic    then any docker or fig or whatever would work as expected against that host
01:01 prologic    but maybe it might be even nicer to go virtualenvwrapper style
01:01 prologic    dcm workon <node>
01:01 prologic    sets up the right env vars and launahces a shell
01:01 prologic    when you exit the shell you go back to your original shell
01:02 prologic    the only thing I'm tossing up between
01:02 pdurbin     I've recently gotten into workon/deactivate. very nice
01:02 prologic    is whether ot use Docker's new TLS/SSL stuff and expose the Docker Remote API over TCP
01:02 prologic    or to just simply setup an SSH tunnel when you do: dcm workon <node>
01:02 prologic    I'm unsure of the pros/cons
01:03 prologic    setting up TLS/SSL with the Docker Remote API though is *NOT* trivial
01:03 prologic    I guess I could just try it? :)
01:03 prologic    searchbot, lucky docker-tunnel pypi
01:03 searchbot   prologic: https://github.com/tonyseek/docker-tunnel
01:03 prologic    See ^^^
01:03 prologic    Was going to rip that off or use it or boror iw, etc
01:04 prologic    it does the ssh tunnel thing I mentioned
01:04 prologic    looks like I could even use it as a library
01:04 pdurbin     cool
01:04 prologic    so
01:04 prologic    dcm workon it is then? :)
01:07 pdurbin     oh, I don't know. I'm interested in Docker but I haven't really used it in anger yet.
01:08 pdurbin     prologic: did I show you https://github.com/IQSS/plaid ?
01:08 pdurbin     I could maybe see using Docker for that some day.
01:09 prologic    hmm
01:09 prologic    not much there :)
01:09 prologic    not sure what it's "going to be"
01:10 pdurbin     oh, if you click the Google Doc
01:10 pdurbin     it's Python-y so I thought you might be interested
01:11 prologic    ahh i see
01:11 pdurbin     right now we deploy to CentOS
01:11 pdurbin     but I guess it could be whatever
01:11 prologic    but that could easily be Docker containers based on CentOS
01:11 pdurbin     sure
01:11 prologic    not that the underlying distro matters at all
01:12 prologic    I'm looking forward to when Docker get to a point where we can separate out build-time from run-time
01:12 pdurbin     well, CentOS 6 is what our Ops guys give us
01:12 prologic    which will result in images that just contain the application and runtime
01:12 prologic    nothing else
01:12 prologic    it won't even look like a distro file system
01:12 prologic    we can already do this right now - but by hand
01:13 prologic    it's a two step process
01:13 prologic    build a docker image that builds an application and it's run-time, then export that out into a tarball, then import that into a new image
01:19 prologic    https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7115
01:20 pdurbin     huh. nested builds
01:22 prologic    https://github.com/docker/docker/issues/7149
01:22 prologic    I kind of like the 2nd proposal better
01:22 prologic    ihmo
01:22 prologic    https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/8021
01:22 prologic    which looks to be a current PR
01:47 pdurbin     do most people who use docker host on their own boxes they set up? or do they use some kind of heroku of the docker world?
01:47 hydrajump   hi prologic
01:48 hydrajump   pdurbin: you should check out the past 2 days announcements from AWS. Especially today's releases ;)
01:48 pdurbin     searchbot: lucky aws announcements
01:48 searchbot   pdurbin: http://aws.amazon.com/new/
01:48 pdurbin     hmm. http://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2014/11/13/introducing-amazon-ec2-container-service/
01:49 hydrajump   https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/cloud-container-management
01:49 pdurbin     semiosis: do you use this stuff?
01:49 hydrajump   pdurbin: it's not widely available yet. You have to sign up for a preview
01:50 pdurbin     right. "preview" at http://aws.amazon.com/ecs/
01:50 hydrajump   lots of exciting stuff :D
01:51 pdurbin     neat
01:52 hydrajump   also I saw your CI discussion earlier...this is one of 3 new services...https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/code-management-and-deployment
02:01 pdurbin     nice. I mean, I'm not very familiar with AWS but I could see people liking this.
02:02 prologic    pdurbin, because Docker is still relatively new
02:02 prologic    a lot of folk use their own Infrastructure
02:02 prologic    But players like Tutum and Amazon are making this less of an issue
02:02 prologic    I tend to like to use my own Infrastructure though
02:06 pdurbin     but at least the containers should be portable. you could start on AWS or your own kit and move the containers around
02:09 pdurbin     LyndsySimon: check out this Flask thing: http://lucumr.pocoo.org/2012/8/5/stateless-and-proud/
02:14 prologic    images
02:15 prologic    but yes :)
02:16 prologic    hmm
02:16 prologic    I guess circuits.web has been able to do this for quite some time
02:16 prologic    even without the help of redis :)
02:21 pdurbin     prologic: somehow I was wondering if you'd say that :)
02:22 pdurbin     via http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-11-13#t1415930129795
02:25 * prologic  reads
02:28 prologic    https://gist.github.com/78185bea0ec976ece439
02:41 pdurbin     cool
03:16 prologic    proof of concept works :)
03:16 prologic    I'll clean it up and add the new feature
03:17 prologic    dcm workon <node-id>
05:33 prologic    https://gist.github.com/bb095843dbf63f1a3fe3
05:36 codex       prologic: welcome :)
05:44 prologic    hi :)
06:09 bear        pdurbin - I run a static site for indieweb but also have behind nginx a flask app for webmention handling and indieauth handling
11:53 pdurbin     bear: ah. nice. I just know LyndsySimon works on one too
14:15 LyndsySimon pdurbin: We seem to be settling on using Tornado for apps that need push/pull. Flask works well enough, but when you start scaling horizontally the limitations of how LocalProxy objects start to become much more apparent.
14:18 pdurbin     hmm. ok
14:18 pdurbin     so far I only have very limited experience with Django
14:46 LyndsySimon I worked with Django some several years ago, but haven't touched it since then. I want to say I was using version 0.97 at the time, if that tells you anything :)
14:47 LyndsySimon I have a side project that I've been writing in Flask, but realized a few days ago that I'm basically re-implemented Django's auth and admin interfaces. I'm seriously considering moving that to Django in the next week or so.
15:01 pdurbin     oh, we've done some of our own auth in Java for sure
17:16 semiosis    pdurbin: i've not used anything containerish yet
17:24 pdurbin     semiosis: but now you can since it's on AWS :)
17:24 semiosis    how do containers fit in an immutable infrastructure?
21:12 prologic    LyndsySimon, you could consider circuits.web :)
21:13 prologic    semiosis, immutable infrastructure?
21:14 semiosis    @lucky immutable infrastructure
21:14 semiosis    @#&$*(^)@#
21:14 semiosis    searchbot: version
21:14 searchbot   semiosis: An error has occurred and has been logged. Please contact this bot's administrator for more information.
21:14 semiosis    bwahahahah
21:15 semiosis    prologic: basically building a golden image for a server then deploying clusters from that image
21:15 prologic    ic
21:15 semiosis    prologic: not updating existing servers with new deploys or config changes, but rather replacing them with new servers from a new golden image
21:16 prologic    by server I assume you mean app/service in the context of Docker?
21:16 prologic    the convention is that a Docker image usually runs one thing or one kind of thing
21:16 semiosis    i mean precisely EC2 instances
21:16 semiosis    i dont see how docker fits into that picture
21:16 prologic    ic
21:16 prologic    ihmo Docker would repalce the whole concept of EC2 instnaces
21:17 prologic    AFAIK AWS are introducing native Docker support anyway
21:17 prologic    to complement their EC2 offerings
21:18 semiosis    guess i'll have to read up ont hat
21:18 prologic    *nods*
21:19 prologic    in any case the whole notion of immutable infrastructure as you call it is already (and has always been) quite possible with Docker - in fact there is no other way really :)
21:19 prologic    and I think that's one of the greater appeals :)
21:19 semiosis    interesting
21:19 prologic    reproducible repeatable infrastructure
21:20 prologic    I've been using Docker since 0.7 :)
21:20 semiosis    on your own hardware?
21:21 prologic    *nods*
21:22 semiosis    ah
21:22 prologic    I now also run it on DO
21:22 prologic    https://bitbucket.org/prologic/dcm
21:22 semiosis    we run in ec2, so i'm v. interested in reducing complexity & cost there.  if docker can help, great, i just havent any idea how it would
21:22 prologic    I wrote this because I couldn't wait for host management to come in Docker
21:22 prologic    which is coming really soon :)
21:23 semiosis    nice
21:23 prologic    I think IHMO AWS will take up Docker fully and whole heartedly
21:23 prologic    they simply can't ignore it
21:23 prologic    it's lightweight virtualization essentially
21:23 prologic    full blown VM(s) might just die off for the most part :)
21:23 prologic    haha
21:24 prologic    except in special use-cases where a full hypervisor is required
21:24 semiosis    windows :(
21:24 prologic    bbs - going out
21:24 semiosis    later
21:24 prologic    even Windows can be Dockerized
21:24 semiosis    oh wow
21:24 prologic    a Docker container/image runing kvm/qemu in privielged mode
21:24 prologic    done :)
21:24 semiosis    neat
22:13 LyndsySimon prologic: I just read all the docs for circuits.web. My mind is currently blown, but I think I like what I see so far.
22:29 LyndsySimon Is there a name for the architecture for which circuits is designed? I've obviously used MVC (and derivatives) in the past, and while that would work here it doesn't seem natural. It almost feels like what I would think of as a model should be a complex component itself.
23:02 pdurbin     LyndsySimon: well, apparently it's not MVC: "circuits.web does not provide high level features such as... Model View Controller" http://circuits.readthedocs.org/en/latest/web/features.html
23:02 LyndsySimon Right - but you could implement it, if you wanted.
23:03 pdurbin     yeah. seems very flexible
23:47 prologic    LyndsySimon, yes - Component Architecture
23:48 prologic    precisely
23:48 prologic    If you want the whole MVC shebang, go right ahead :)
23:49 prologic    for the most port, myself and other users get away with Controller(s) (we do provide a simple Component for that), Templates and JS/CSS :)
23:49 prologic    but yeah ideally your application should be comprised of composable components really :)
23:52 prologic    here's probably two examples of reuseable components in the context of circuits.web (dataconv the project itself is/was an experimental cli data transformer and I later toyed with the idea of making it web enabled):
23:52 prologic    auth.py: https://bitbucket.org/prologic/dataconv/src/ed47d8914ccd8f6e4d406d0dd2f8d76487e3d7be/auth.py?at=default
23:53 prologic    server.py: https://bitbucket.org/prologic/dataconv/src/ed47d8914ccd8f6e4d406d0dd2f8d76487e3d7be/server.py?at=default
23:53 prologic    the more interesting components are probably JinjaRendere, Authentication and LoginManager
