18:35 pdurbin we didn't use the rpms at all. but in the future, when we put this on a new host, i bet we will
18:36 pdurbin so... i'm not super invested in that spec file anymore. probably won't want to collaborate on github on it any time soon...
18:38 whorka  yeah, beware that Articles (if you give them a "text area" field) are not generally treated as plaintext... so when you display them any stuff in &lt;anglebrackets&gt; will get stripped out, and when you insert them any anglebrackets will get entity-encoded.
18:39 whorka  I have patches to render both as literal plaintext if you're interested.
19:08 pdurbin whorka: ok. thanks
