13:24 bene    pdurbin: did you try their software? the link above doesn't give very much insight into it
13:40 pdurbin bene: nope. in the paper they talk about how an empty reply is like a "+1"
13:40 bene    i was wondering about the signalling mechanism for some of the features they are talking about
13:40 pdurbin and how you can send an email to a subset of the group for feedback and approval before having it go to the full list
13:41 bene    that sounds like a misfeature to me
13:41 pdurbin I like how it says "A mailing list designed to reduce noise and encourage sharing" at https://github.com/haystack/mailx
13:42 pdurbin in the paper they talk about how people hold back
13:42 bene    that's as much about the community as it about the technology
13:42 bene    solving people problems with technology only sorta works i think
13:43 bene    what score/categories do you read slashdot at?
13:43 pdurbin all software is social
13:43 bene    heh
13:43 bene    you've been reading foucault!
13:45 pdurbin "these days, almost all software is social software" http://www.jwz.org/doc/groupware.html via http://blog.stackoverflow.com/2009/09/podcast-69/
13:46 pdurbin I read slashdot religiously for maybe four years and then abruptly stopped
13:46 bene    yeah
13:47 bene    98/99 to about 2004 for me
13:47 bene    then RSS took over
13:47 pdurbin I used Google Reader religiously for about a year.
13:48 bene    it was several years for me, then a year in the woods while figuring out how to replace it
13:48 bene    feedbin + reeder is a really nice combo
13:49 pdurbin I feel like enough good stuff comes to me from channels like this and twitter and google+
13:49 pdurbin and podcasts
13:49 bene    i don't google+
13:50 pdurbin I never got into hacker news.
13:50 bene    and podcasts don't really fit my life right now
13:51 bene    yeah
13:51 bene    a bit of reddit
13:51 bene    and only the hackernews stuff that gets heavily promoted via rss/twitter
13:51 pdurbin never got into reddit. I'm kind of anti-forum, I guess
13:53 pdurbin murmur is one of the projects from http://people.csail.mit.edu/karger/
13:53 pdurbin I feel like I should see if he's giving a talk some day or something.
13:54 pdurbin Amy X Zhang on Twitter: "Read our Haystack blog post written by @karger and I on mailing lists' staying power and what they can teach us: http://t.co/3MBl4DvzIm" - https://twitter.com/amyxzh/status/595584585112506368
13:55 pdurbin http://haystack.csail.mit.edu/blog/2015/05/05/mailing-lists-why-are-they-still-here-whats-wrong-with-them-and-how-can-we-fix-them/
13:56 bene    i don't think they can do it
13:56 bene    not building on top of email
13:57 bene    which means it's going to end up as another random web forum app
13:58 pdurbin yeah
13:58 pdurbin it's tough
13:59 bene    the list app could accept emails in any format and strip out the content/body and then wrap it in some custom HTML that would preserve context/formatting and enable some links for the +1 and filtering options
13:59 bene    but then you're stuck with HTML email
13:59 bene    which as a mutt user, i personally hate
14:00 pdurbin I feel like we could still go a long way toward improving discussion online.
14:00 bene    although i guess it would be possible to have the 'w3m -dump' output be usable
14:04 pdurbin they seem to say you can use any client
14:05 bene    in-band signalling by adding custom headers or specially formatted text lines/subjects is probably not going to be successful
14:05 bene    that's my gut feeling
14:08 pdurbin yeah, only power users will use the special tag things
14:09 pdurbin but you know, it's fine that new IRC users don't know that you can emote
14:12 pdurbin I wonder how well one can interact with Discourse via email.
14:14 pdurbin "To respond, reply to this email or visit https://meta.discourse.org/t/configuring-github-login-for-discourse/13745/7 in your browser."
14:15 pdurbin should work sounds like
14:22 pdurbin had our first conference this week by the way. went very well: https://twitter.com/hashtag/dataverse2015
