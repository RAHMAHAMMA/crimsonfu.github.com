15:30 pdurbin what do you call something that's load balanced? cluster.example.com? I feel like maybe there's a better word than "cluster".
16:03 dotplus pool?
16:04 dotplus if you're looking for an A/CNAME, just it call it the thing: smtp.example.com, www.example.com
16:05 dotplus and then the individual hosts are foo-N.example.com, your load balancers are lbN (or even smtp-lbN)
16:13 pdurbin hmm, maybe pool
16:13 pdurbin dotplus: it's for testing so the emphasis is that it's load balanced
