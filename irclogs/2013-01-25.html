04:35 jimi_c    i must say, using vagrant with jenkins is much easier without using the vagrant plugin
04:35 jimi_c    running all the commands via bash scripts works better, and i can actually cancel builds and have the vm be destroy
04:35 jimi_c    'ed
04:37 jimi_c    also matrixed builds are awesome
11:04 pdurbin   jimi_c: cool
14:13 pdurbin   does anyone know how this "mirrored from" was set up? https://github.com/apache/ant ... is this some official github thing?
14:17 * pdurbin adds a comment: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11370239/creating-an-official-github-mirror#comment20250253_11370266
14:19 pdurbin   hmm, this seems like a good way to set up a mirror: https://exyr.org/2011/git-mirrors/
14:34 larsks    Did someone here have a favorite web-based irc client of some sort?
14:43 pdurbin   http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=crimsonfu
14:43 pdurbin   actually, i think agoddard mentioned one recently
14:50 larsks    Yeah, I think so too.  Are the logs for this channel searchable?
