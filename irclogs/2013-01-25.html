04:35 jimi_c       i must say, using vagrant with jenkins is much easier without using the vagrant plugin
04:35 jimi_c       running all the commands via bash scripts works better, and i can actually cancel builds and have the vm be destroy
04:35 jimi_c       'ed
04:37 jimi_c       also matrixed builds are awesome
11:04 pdurbin      jimi_c: cool
14:13 pdurbin      does anyone know how this "mirrored from" was set up? https://github.com/apache/ant ... is this some official github thing?
14:17 * pdurbin    adds a comment: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/11370239/creating-an-official-github-mirror#comment20250253_11370266
14:19 pdurbin      hmm, this seems like a good way to set up a mirror: https://exyr.org/2011/git-mirrors/
14:34 larsks       Did someone here have a favorite web-based irc client of some sort?
14:43 pdurbin      http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=crimsonfu
14:43 pdurbin      actually, i think agoddard mentioned one recently
14:50 larsks       Yeah, I think so too.  Are the logs for this channel searchable?
14:53 pdurbin      hell yes. one sec. i'll put the latest in git
14:53 GitHub189    [crimsonfu.github.com] pdurbin pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/crimsonfu/crimsonfu.github.com/commit/04598041013687fba3ddab7e187111e182099c3e
14:53 GitHub189    crimsonfu.github.com/master 0459804 Philip Durbin: fetch latest irc logs
14:54 pdurbin      larsks: there you go. i recommend ack :)
14:54 larsks       So noted!
14:54 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky better than grep
14:54 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://betterthangrep.com/
14:55 pdurbin      there's also http://irclog.perlgeek.de/search.pl?channel=crimsonfu but it could be better. see http://irclog.perlgeek.de/ilbot/2013-01-21
14:56 larsks       I like how that last one lets you limit searches to a specific nick.
14:57 pdurbin      larsks: irccloud: http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2013-01-09#i_1572
14:57 pdurbin      https://www.irccloud.com/
15:04 larsks       Hmmm, a "subscription service".
15:25 spilth       Part 2 is up! http://spilth.org/blog/2013/01/24/automated-vm-generation-with-vagrant-jenkins-and-amazon-s3/
15:28 pdurbin      spilth: i'm gonna have to give this a look sometime. seems great
15:31 spilth       I'm curious to know if others have any issues along the way (if it's clear enough)
15:32 spilth       Though - https://twitter.com/mitchellh/status/294681590339104769
15:33 pdurbin      oh. yeah. `gem install vagrant` is going away
15:35 spilth       Yea, a bummer. Makes automating things harder.
15:36 pdurbin      "I doing this on my Mac so there were a few things I needed to set up before getting started"
15:36 pdurbin      meh. it's just a dmg you download and install once
15:37 pdurbin      just ignore that vagrant is in ruby, that it ever was on the gem forge or whatever they call it
15:37 pdurbin      :)
15:37 spilth       Do python libraries even HAVE a cool name?
15:37 spilth       ;-)
15:38 spilth       The point being that you'll now have to manually set up Vagrant on your Jenkins box
15:38 spilth       Hopefully it can be puppetized
15:39 spilth       But that is still a cloudy, fog of war area for me right now
15:41 pdurbin      spilth: you run jenkins on a mac? i'm confused
15:41 spilth       I ran it to test out what I was doing but it shouldn't matter where Jenkins is running.
15:42 pdurbin      ok
15:42 pdurbin      spilth: you know jimi_c was just talking about this: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2013-01-25#i_6373706
15:44 spilth       I'm kind of torn on how much the build system should know about the build process
15:44 spilth       Ideally I wouldn't even need to use the Amazon S3 Jenkins plugin. It should be part of the build script.
15:45 spilth       Maybe not "ideally" but it's an alternative I'd consider
15:45 spilth       Keeping the contract with the CI server very light
15:47 pdurbin      yeah
15:47 pdurbin      oh, speaking of CI, this was cool, from yesterday's talk...
15:47 pdurbin      when someone submits a pull request to openscholar, like this: https://github.com/openscholar/openscholar/pull/1483
15:47 pdurbin      it kicks off a build in travis to show if it failed or not: https://travis-ci.org/openscholar/openscholar/builds/4332347
15:48 spilth       Is that a feature of Travis?
15:49 pdurbin      i dunno but i linked the #openscholar guys here. maybe they'll explain :)
15:51 pdurbin      github service hook
15:52 spilth       http://about.travis-ci.org/blog/announcing-pull-request-support/#Enter-Travisbot
15:52 spilth       "In contrast to most self-made solutions out there, we actually test the merged version, rather than just the fork or feature branch. Thus, we also take into account changes made upstream after the repository has been forked."
15:55 spilth       I really need to spend more time with Travis CI. I only have one dinky project on there - https://travis-ci.org/spilth/ubyray
15:55 pdurbin      huh. with travis builds are done in a VM: Why does Travis do for me that Jenkins or Gerrit doesn't? | Hacker News - http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=3231532
15:56 pdurbin      so much shiny stuff out there
15:56 spilth       I don't know that you can run your own instance of Travis CI yet though
15:56 pdurbin      no? that's unfortunate
15:56 spilth       It's open source though. Not sure what it takes to stand up your own.
15:57 pdurbin      ok
15:57 spilth       There's a Pro version that's in beta. I guess you can pay to keep things private if you need?
16:17 pdurbin      kinda like the github business model, i guess
16:31 pdurbin      i forget if i threw this over the wall already. in case i didn't... drush script to export content from a Drupal book module: http://drupal.org/documentation/modules/book - https://gist.github.com/4635780
17:13 spilth       http://www.securityweek.com/github-search-makes-easy-discovery-encryption-keys-passwords-source-code
18:06 pdurbin      huh. hadn't seen A Whole New Code Search Â· GitHub Blog - https://github.com/blog/1381-a-whole-new-code-search
18:06 pdurbin      i've been crying since google killed Code Search
21:45 pdurbin      despite this i'm still not quite convinced to switch from markdown to asciidoc: http://www.evanchooly.com/logs/%23%23jsf/2013-01-25
21:49 semiosis     that 404-looking thing doesnt convince me either!
21:50 spilth       wish the joins were a lighter color as to not distract
21:50 spilth       wait, are we talking about the log or the contents of th elog?
21:50 semiosis     hmm, rekonq was converting the first %23 to a # so the page wasnt loading for me
21:51 semiosis     chrome seems to load it ok
21:51 spilth       lame, no entry highlighting ;-)
23:13 pdurbin      you guys are spoiled on decent irc logging :)
