13:40 ben_e    capturing stdout/err in bash is easy
13:40 ben_e    tcsh is not as flexible with redirection as bash
13:40 ben_e    but if you have a working perl script, why would you convert it to a shell script?
13:41 ben_e    i think the deafening silence is because no one wants to encourage you down that path :P
13:43 pdurbin  heh. it's not for me. I'm happy with my solution :)
13:43 pdurbin  ben_e: but thanks
15:56 ben_e    vim has syntax highlighting for strace output

19:12 pdurbin  bleh!
19:12 pdurbin  "OS X's tar also knows how to convert the ._ members back to native formats, but the ._ files are usually kept when archives are extracted on other platforms."
