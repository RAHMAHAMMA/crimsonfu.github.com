03:00 pdurbin  here's the original version of the skiing video i just uploaded: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KPxtQEVXFPA
03:01 pdurbin  i saw some message like "your video seems a little shaky. want me to try to stabilize it?"
03:01 pdurbin  so i clicked yes and check out how much better this version is: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-duGYGAxFGw
