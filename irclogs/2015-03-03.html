00:21 * pdurbin hears crickets
01:38 bear      rbase is old school relational database stuff
01:39 bear      *old* school
01:40 bear      it was the oracle of the day - back when everyone was using dBase files and the like - if you wanted business level you used R:Base
01:40 bear      R:Base went on to cause other form/query database systems to be created
01:41 bear      it's report form template language was the base for things like Access
01:56 pdurbin   bear: would you recommend it for a project in 2015?
01:57 bear      in a wierd way yes, because if they have legacy requirements...
01:57 bear      technically it's still a valid relation database - just not internet scale, talking about internal enterprise network stuff
01:57 bear      IMO it's the same as someone asking to use MSSQL
01:58 bear      the reason to use it is the same as to not use it - do they have in house rbase dba's?
02:00 pdurbin   or a lot of code written around it maybe
02:02 bear      yea, as a sql style database it's just as modern as any of the non-internet sql dbases
02:02 bear      I just hadn't seen it in use in decades (but I also haven't done enterprise app dbase work in decades)
02:04 bear      we have a current client that we are doing some tech debt archeology for - they are using 2008 era MSSQL
02:09 pdurbin   that I've heard of at least
15:25 dotplus   heck, I'm not sure if I should say this in a logged channel, because I don't ever want to be a MSFT apologist. But actually MSSQL can be a valid choice in certain situations, especially in combination with Visual Studio. At least the modern versions allow (some) people to get Valuable Work Done.
15:26 dotplus   whether they would have been better off learning the unix tools from the beginning and walking that path is, of course, up for (futile) debate.
18:42 bear      (dotplus said what I was trying to say in a much cleaner manner)
19:25 pdurbin   https://about.gitlab.com/2015/03/03/gitlab-acquires-gitorious/
19:25 bear      yea
21:50 semiosis  i hope they didnt pay too much.  gitorious was pretty crappy
21:50 semiosis  and gitlab is beyond amazing
22:07 bene      gitlab is pretty nice
22:07 bene      i set up an in-house server for us
23:04 semiosis  thinking about switching to my mac mini at work for daily use.  any tips or must-have apps I should know about?
23:05 semiosis  are there any task management apps, window switchers, terminal/IRC stuff, etc that you can't live without on your macs?
23:06 prologic  what do you guys think about a tiny linux distro with busybox built against uclibc, kernel, finit and a package manager written in python (bundled statically)?
23:07 prologic  oh and probably dropbear
23:07 prologic  total size might come in at ~20-30MB
23:07 prologic  might also throw Docker in there too for good measure by default
23:09 semiosis  well i use openwrt, that's similar to what you describe
23:14 bear      for osx - iTerm2, Textual and then anything else you need via homebrew
23:15 prologic  so no :)
23:15 prologic  abandon the idea :)
23:17 semiosis  bear: thanks
23:19 bear      I use homebrew to install the latest openssl, python, node, git and wget for example
23:19 bear      if you point homebrew to install into your user dir you don't muc with system versions of them
23:27 semiosis  do you use any alternative apps for the mac os desktop?  finder alternative?  app switchers?  etc?
23:27 semiosis  i'm used to kde and all of its power gui features :)
23:27 bear      not really - I tend to use mine as a fancy terminal host
23:28 bear      albert has a lot of use at our office
23:28 semiosis  albert?
23:28 bear      oops - http://www.alfredapp.com/
23:28 semiosis  ah
23:29 semiosis  cool, thanks
23:30 bear      oh, and it's worth buying vmware for your mac if your going to do any vagrant work
23:31 semiosis  i'm going to be doing a LOT of vagrant work
23:31 bear      the speed difference between free and paid is well worth
23:31 semiosis  what about virtualbox?
23:31 bear      we avoid it
23:31 semiosis  hmmm
23:32 semiosis  i see several vmware editions, which do you recommend?
23:32 semiosis  fusion?  pro?  workstation?
23:33 semiosis  tbh i'll probably try vbox first, it's been great for me on linux
23:33 bear      vmware fusion 7.1.1
23:34 bear      the biggest difference is speed, but with a new mini you may not notice it at first
23:34 semiosis  it's the last gen mini, but it's fast
23:34 bear      I keep asking my coworker to write a blog post on all the pain points but we've all been hyper busy
23:41 pdurbin   semiosis: you're giving up your beloved kubuntu?!?
23:45 semiosis  pdurbin: i can't let my ideology get in the way.  these days i'm less interested in "using linux" and more interested in doing awesome shit.  my linux desktop obsession is getting in the way
23:46 semiosis  first i'll switch over at work, then maybe down the road switch over at home too
23:46 semiosis  we'll see how it goes
23:46 pdurbin   oh at work, forget it. I use a mac, of course :)
23:46 pdurbin   I have shit to do.
23:46 semiosis  srsly!
23:47 pdurbin   and I'm not going to be "that guy" ... the only one who runs linux
23:48 semiosis  ha
23:49 semiosis  pdurbin: any response to my mac apps question?
23:50 semiosis  pdurbin: what hypervisor do you use with vagrant on your mac?
23:50 pdurbin   um. I like having an extra terminal app installed: iTerm2
23:50 pdurbin   semiosis: virtualbox
23:52 pdurbin   I use Adium to log into gtalk or whatever they call it now
