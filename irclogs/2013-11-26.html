00:00 pdurbin  my ruby looks like perl. I miss how perl works so I add hash = Hash.new{ |h,k| h[k] = Hash.new(&h.default_proc) }
00:00 TrueDD   these two languages looks so similar on first view that it might be tempting to start programming the way I did with Perl
00:00 semiosis pdurbin: import perl.lang.BadHabits;
00:00 semiosis wait thats java
00:01 semiosis require "perl/badhabits"
00:01 semiosis pdurbin:  you should make a ruby gem that does that for you, call it perlhabits or something
00:02 semiosis ;)
00:02 TrueDD   my co-worker told me about that, you're right
00:05 TrueDD   but I think I'll try not to use those ... "facilities"?
00:05 pdurbin  TrueDD: here, give this a try: https://github.com/crimsonfu/code/tree/master/katas/autovivification
00:06 pdurbin  semiosis: where's your solution?!?1!
00:06 TrueDD   cause I'd like to learn the language the way it's been thought
00:06 semiosis bah
00:07 pdurbin  agoddard: you submitted 2 solutions :)
00:17 TrueDD   :)
00:19 TrueDD   well, it's getting late
00:19 TrueDD   I think I'll get to bed
00:20 TrueDD   that was nice talking with you
00:20 TrueDD   I'll be back
00:20 TrueDD   have a good evening
00:20 TrueDD   talk to you soon
00:21 TrueDD   bye!
17:56 melodie  hi
17:57 melodie  pdurbin when you are around I would like to ask you, how you managed to have a "+" in front of your name on your G+ account. I noticed some people does have it and some don't? I tried to find some info on the web about it but failed so far, could you help me with that?
18:02 pdurbin  melodie: http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/10/29/google-starts-offering-custom-urls-accounts-30-days-old-10-followers-profile-photo/
18:03 melodie  pdurbin I look, thanks
18:04 melodie  pdurbin this is fairly recent!
18:04 melodie  I have finished by thinking I should create a G+ account with my IRL name (my brother has one, and well it seems after all that it could be useful)
18:06 melodie  what about the side image, can you customize it, or choose among several, or is it meant to stay as is?
19:54 melodie  pdurbin just a thought: does a picture of my cat count?
23:01 pdurbin  I'm ok with cats
23:44 melodie  pdurbin you are and so am I, but would Google be ok with a cat's face profile? (for custom url ;) )
