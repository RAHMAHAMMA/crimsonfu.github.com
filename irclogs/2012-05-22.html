12:08 SEJeff  pdurbin, Nice, you know the python equiv, right? A list comprehension: [ i.strip() for i in array]
12:09 SEJeff  or if you wanted to be overly complex: map(lambda x: x.strip(), array)

15:50 pdurbin "For esx:// and vpx:// the default HTTPS port is 443" -- http://libvirt.org/drvesx.html#uriformat
15:53 pdurbin and i see port 443 as "VI / vSphere Client to ESX/ESXi Host management connection" for example, at VMware KB: TCP and UDP Ports required to access vCenter Server, ESX hosts, and other network components - http://kb.vmware.com/selfservice/microsites/microsite.do?cmd=displayKC&amp;docType=kc&amp;externalId=1012382&amp;sliceId=1&amp;docTypeID=DT_KB_1_1

20:36 pdurbin "@philipdurbin Which do you use for Windows: Strawberry Perl or ActiveState Perl?" -- https://twitter.com/jonahbishop/status/204994715530170368
20:36 pdurbin what say ye?
20:37 SEJeff  Wouldn't activestate be the one to go with?
20:38 SEJeff  I mean activestate supports and maintains perl for HP-UX as well
20:39 SEJeff  Oh it looks like in newer HP-UX 11i, they went away from ActivePerl and are using the normal open source perl. About time.
