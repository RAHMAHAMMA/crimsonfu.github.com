00:15 pdurbin bene: this vaurien thing seems pretty cool
00:27 pdurbin are you using tools like this in your day job?
00:43 melodie pdurbin a brand new project which you might be interested to know about, https://caliopen.org
00:44 pdurbin melodie: right but I have nothing to hide: https://caliopen.org/faq
00:44 pdurbin I dont' think!
00:45 melodie it's not about *you*
00:45 melodie :)

00:55 pdurbin melodie: well hold on, please. I'm as upset about the NSA as anyone.
00:57 melodie pdurbin the French government is about to follow their lead: and will vote a law identical on some points as what is in the Patriot Act : on may 5th
00:57 melodie just the laws once voted are not reviewed each year
00:57 melodie the "loi sur le renseignement" was not reviewed since 1992 they say
00:58 melodie pdurbin well I am glad to read that you are not approving their ways
01:05 pdurbin it's a violation, all this spying
01:08 pdurbin melodie: isn't it past your bedtime? :)
01:56 melodie pdurbin if they ask you aren't aware. :p
14:15 bene    pdurbin: i am not using vaurien or anything like it, but the qa team here was asking for a tool like that
14:16 pdurbin cool that they're asking for tools like that
14:16 bene    yeah
14:16 bene    but qa suggested a bunch of client side tools and some commercial stuff
14:17 bene    whereas i think the better approach would be to have the degradation config backed into the qa test plan
14:18 bene    so you fire off a CI job for testing and it configures the tool with the right latency/loss settings and then runs the automated test
14:18 pdurbin automate all the things
14:18 bene    we have *way* too much manual stuff at work
21:45 melodie hi
