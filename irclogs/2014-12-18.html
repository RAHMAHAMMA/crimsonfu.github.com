00:56 hydrajump  can anyone recommend a rails developer whose available for a couple of days job working on an existing rails 4 app?
00:57 prologic   permissive?
00:57 prologic   hydrajump if you said python I'd say sure yeap me :)
00:57 prologic   :P
00:58 hydrajump  hehe thanks :D
00:58 hydrajump  not easy finding good devs who actually do what they say they will
00:59 prologic   that's true
01:17 pdurbin    those lazy devs
01:32 prologic   yeah :P
01:32 prologic   damn them all to hell :)
01:32 prologic   oh wiat
01:32 prologic   I'm a dev
01:32 prologic   rats :(
01:32 prologic   got my new server working last night
01:32 prologic   a little VX11 CRUX VM at hetzner.de
01:33 pdurbin    prologic: if you want URLs to be clickable in the logs made by ilbot3, you have to add http://
01:43 prologic   heh
01:43 prologic   http://hetzner.de
01:43 prologic   there :P
01:44 prologic   anyone heard of this statusnet / gnusocial thing?
01:44 prologic   any opinions?
01:51 pdurbin    statusnet is no more, but yes it lives on a gnusocial, I guess. the guy who wrote statusnet has since created http://pump.io
01:54 prologic   oh?
01:54 * prologic looks
01:55 pdurbin    prologic: node.js! async! you'll love pump.io!
01:57 prologic   https://1realtime.net/prologic
01:57 prologic   cool :)
01:57 prologic   I created an account on their hosted version of pump.io
01:57 prologic   I'll try it out over the next few days
02:06 * pdurbin  has an account at https://microca.st/pdurbin ... "2 years ago" on the more recent post
02:07 pdurbin    prologic: I left some notes here: http://irclog.greptilian.com/spanworm/2013-02-26#i_3540
02:08 pdurbin    looks like I opened this ticket: https://github.com/e14n/pump.io/issues/440
03:45 prologic   So i pump.io decentarlized ?
09:28 * prologic is hacking up a gopher daemon in circuits
09:28 prologic   :)
11:29 pdurbin    prologic: yes. decentralized and federated. rare in that way
13:59 prologic   https://bitbucket.org/prologic/cgod
13:59 prologic   pdurbin, cool so I should run a pump instance on my server yeah?
13:59 prologic   get in on this oss/decentralized/federated social crap :)
14:28 dotplus    prologic: "circuits"?
14:28 dotplus    I don't think you can mean ASIC, right?
14:33 prologic   ASIC?
14:33 prologic   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/circuits
14:37 pdurbin    this confusion never comes up in #circuits ;)
14:37 prologic   no indeed :)
14:48 dotplus    https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application-specific_integrated_circuit
14:59 dotplus    huh. circuits sounds interesting. the purpose of it is to make it easy to build network service daemons?
15:02 prologic   sure
15:03 prologic   or web apps
15:03 prologic   or anything that does I/O
15:06 dotplus    how does it do performance-wise? multi-thread/multi-process? python for that sort of thing just makes me think of multiprocessing and "fails at anything but small scale", but that might be because the primary app I'm thinking of (bcfg2) was horrid.
15:10 dotplus    mrrh, you people are too interesting. I have work I'm supposed to be doing
15:12 prologic   async I/O
15:13 prologic   event-driven
15:13 prologic   real world performance is acceptable for what the framework does
15:13 prologic   raw banchmarks put circuits (the core) at ~50k events/s on my hw and ~150k event/s with PyPy
15:14 prologic   circuits.web fairs far worse but it's quite a feature rich web framework
15:14 prologic   so benefits from load balancing :)
15:15 prologic   circuits is design to scale :)
15:15 prologic   you should do as little CPU bound work as possbile in any given event handler
15:15 prologic   CPU bound work should be shoved off to a Worker (circuits.Worker)
