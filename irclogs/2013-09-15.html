21:34 melodie      hi here!
21:34 pdurbin      melodie: what's new?
21:34 melodie      a new website has just born, especially to greet the 30th birtday of GNU ! \o/
21:35 pdurbin      nice!
21:35 melodie      it is GNU Birthday http://gnu-birthday.eu.org !
21:35 melodie      soon a few words in it, and next all will be invited to add their greetings to the GNU project !
21:35 pdurbin      looks... minimal ... but nice :)
21:36 melodie      CalimeroTeknic work, with the technical support of captainfab for the eu.org domain name
21:36 melodie      eu.org domain names are free of charge, and need some skill for the configuration
21:37 * pdurbin    likes free stuff
21:37 melodie      http://eu.org/
21:38 melodie      "EU.org, free domain names since 1996"
21:38 melodie      ""Companies have voted with their feet [on the issue of domains], they want to have domain names that are international or at least country neutral. The same freedom should apply to individuals; all individuals should be able to have and own their own domain names".
21:38 melodie      Paul Mockapetris, creator of the DNS, in On the Internet, September/October 1996."
21:39 pdurbin      hmm, eu.org might be older than the Euro ;)
22:11 melodie      indeed, euro appeared in 2000
22:12 pdurbin      sounds about right
22:12 melodie      well 1999
22:12 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky euro
22:12 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euro
22:20 pdurbin      you know what would be cool? ... if I could define a keyboard shortcut for Ctrl-a, which I use in weechat (and formerly irssi) to switch to the window with activity... if I could have it so if I hit F1 (or whatever) ... it would somehow map to Ctrl-a. At the moment, I'm using weechat within gnome-terminal
22:21 pdurbin      oh, duh, and my muscle memory tells me it's actually Alt-a, not Ctrl-a :)
22:22 melodie      ?
22:22 melodie      how weird
22:22 melodie      why use a text irc client in a gui console?
22:23 melodie      is it what you consider fun doing?
22:23 melodie      :D
22:23 pdurbin      I enjoy terminal apps :)
22:24 melodie      :)
22:24 melodie      all clients are terminal in fact
22:24 melodie      including gui
22:24 melodie      right or wrong ?
22:24 pdurbin      you can't run xchat inside a terminal
22:26 pdurbin      hmm, this probably what I want: http://www.weechat.org/files/doc/weechat_faq.en.html#customize_key_bindings
22:27 melodie      ok ! ^^
22:27 melodie      heading to bed, good night pdurbin
