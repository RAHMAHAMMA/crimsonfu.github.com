00:03 melodie   ok
00:03 melodie   firefox gives a blank page for this one: http://nodeup.com/fiftysix
00:04 melodie   ah no
00:04 melodie   it was just slow to display
00:04 pdurbin   maybe it's running node.js ;)
00:04 melodie   WURLFL ?
00:05 melodie   or the website?
00:05 melodie   maybe it has too many visits for the server to stand it :o)
00:09 * pdurbin can't believe melodie is friends with RMS
00:10 melodie   I am not, I admire what he did and like what he does as far as political notes are concerned
00:11 melodie   I have written to him a mail a few times, for things I thought important.
00:12 melodie   he has created a full movement, just by his first idea which he still continues, 30 years later! isn't that unique?
00:35 pdurbin   I admire RMS too
01:06 melodie   pdurbin :)
01:06 melodie   have to go to sleep, good night
