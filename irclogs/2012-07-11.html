01:52 pdurbin it turns out there *is* a puppet podcast. i just tweeted this: enjoyed puppetcast #1, @grim_radical and @stahnma talking about puppetdb and storeconfigs: http://puppetcast.s3.amazonaws.com/puppetcast-episode001-2012-06-04.mp3
01:53 pdurbin found it at https://twitter.com/stahnma/status/222849773659631617
01:55 pdurbin it's short and sweet, only ~15 minutes, but very technical, about how nice puppetdb is. sjoeboo set this up the other day and showed me the dashboard
02:12 pdurbin interesting that puppetdb is written in clojure: https://github.com/puppetlabs/puppetdb/blob/master/src/com/puppetlabs/puppetdb/command.clj
12:49 pdurbin interesting. sjoeboo just pointed out that https://twitter.com/planetpuppet is sending out some links. "Puppet Labs : Puppetcast Episode 2", "Puppet Labs : Puppetcast Episode 3".  but they seem to be 404's... "Sadly, the requested resource was not found on this site"
