11:43 pdurbin   my SMS history is magically back. I also noticed that the Hangouts app updated itself. long live Android, I guess.
21:22 pdurbin   any recommendations for something like http://dataprobe.com/iboot.html or http://amzn.to/1x0s4kY or http://www.digital-loggers.com/lpc.html ?
21:37 bene      those are from abcd today
21:42 pdurbin   yeah
21:42 bene      don't like your options?
21:42 bene      i thought that was some museum guy asking?
21:43 pdurbin   I just thought maybe someone here would have opinions.
21:43 bene      that digital loggers one looks okay for non-rack use
21:44 bene      you can probably buy an addressable PDU off ebay for the same money and get more ports/higher power use
21:44 pdurbin   yeah, from the picture it sure didn't look like it'd go in a rack
21:46 pdurbin   I don't even remember what we used. The vendors kept buying each other.
21:47 bene      apc and tripp lite
21:47 bene      that's mostly what we have for rack mounted PDUs
21:47 pdurbin   avocent. that was it. they worked fine, I guess
21:47 bene      there may be a stray belkin in there?
21:48 pdurbin   http://avocent.com seems to redirect to http://emersonnetworkpower.com
21:48 bene      we have avocent KVMs
21:49 bene      if you port scanner them with the right flags, they reboot
21:49 pdurbin   heh
21:49 bene      s/scanner/scan
21:49 pdurbin   it's a feature!
21:49 bene      it's like built in PDU!
21:49 bene      KVM locked up? TCP FIN scan your avocent for perform a warm reset!
21:50 bene      what is up with my brain today
21:50 bene      all those connector words are coming out wrong
21:50 pdurbin   bene: I didn't even read your rant yesterday. I'll catch up at some point.
21:51 bene      was i ranting?
21:52 pdurbin   bellyaching maybe :)
21:52 bene      i'm just tellin' like it is, man
21:52 pdurbin   heh

21:54 pdurbin   as I drink a beer on a day I took vacation to hand a wad of cash to some plumbers. problem fixed at least
21:54 * pdurbin knocks on wood
21:54 bene      plumbers are the worst
21:55 bene      they're all failed carpenters
21:55 pdurbin   meh, these guys were fine. and the cost will be split 3 ways
