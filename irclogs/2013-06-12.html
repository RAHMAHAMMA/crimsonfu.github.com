22:34 Whoop     :(
22:35 Whoop     ZNC fucked something, it appears the command trottling option in 1.0 doesnt work
22:35 Whoop     freenode disconnected me constantly as I was joining too many channels
22:35 pdurbin_m heh. all good
22:35 Whoop     and I was AFK, so it continued forever >_<
22:35 Whoop     sorry
22:36 * Whoop   blames ZNC
22:36 Whoop     stupid stupid behaviour
22:36 Whoop     then again, I'm a channel whore
22:36 Whoop     so hey, maybe my fault ;)
22:36 Whoop     I fixed by parting about 30 channels
22:36 Whoop     "fixed"
22:37 pdurbin_m hmm
22:40 pdurbin_m Whoop: I'm curious how many you're down to :)
