10:51 Azgarech nice prologic
10:52 Azgarech I am looking for a torrent tracker dedicated for the sharing of linux iso
10:52 prologic hah thanks :)
10:52 Azgarech I want to upload on it the is of Viperr 7
10:52 Azgarech some user with crape connection would like this feature :)
10:52 prologic say what? :P
10:52 prologic I don't understand
10:52 prologic haha
10:54 Azgarech I will try to make myself clear :)
10:54 Azgarech I am one of the maintener of Viperr a remix of Fedora using Openbox
10:55 Azgarech some of our users requested a sharing of the iso by torrent
10:55 Azgarech I am looking for a tracker for help the sharing of the torrent. Using only DHT node is not very effective over internet
10:56 Azgarech I don't want to put my torrent on website like the piratebay and so, not very classy
10:56 Azgarech I was expecting to find a specialised tracker for linux distribution
10:58 prologic ahh I see
13:40 larsks   Azgarech: there are sites that cater to "legitimate" torrents. Maybe http://linuxtracker.org/?
13:41 larsks   Azgarech: Also, it looks as if ibiblio.org has a tracker that can be used by open source projects, based on this ticket: http://answers.ibiblio.org/questions/133/upload-permissions-request.html
13:44 Azgarech I found the first link.
13:44 Azgarech but the FAQ is near a black hole
