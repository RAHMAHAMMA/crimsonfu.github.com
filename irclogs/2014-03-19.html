17:24 skay         I am excited that more and more scientists are doing things like trying to do the equiv of automated deployment. (whether they realize it or not). https://plus.google.com/u/0/+ShriramKrishnamurthi/posts/Tf4D2HKQRKi
17:26 skay         I am also SQUIRREL hey look I am helping with google summer of code for my friend Tim's project.
17:28 skay         and I want more applicatants and the deadline is 2 days
17:28 skay         timsvideos http://www.reddit.com/r/opensource/comments/20pp4d/summer_of_code_supports_open_hardware_projects/ and I want more hardware people to apply, but I am helping with python parts of the stack
17:29 skay         (I miss doing hardware though I haven't done embedded programming in forever)
17:29 pdurbin      maybe we should rename #crimsonfu to #squirrelfu http://irclog.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/2014-03-19#i_7422 :)
17:30 skay         hey I am half on topic. configuration management of science
17:31 skay         be happy I didn't say science ops
17:31 pdurbin      close enough
17:32 skay         I must away to change buttons and urls
17:32 skay         I want some frontend people!
17:32 skay         I want to do backend services! grumpyface!
17:32 skay         at least changing urls means I get to think about url design
17:33 * skay       finishes minute of grump
17:34 skay         more interested in getting a gsoc student who would like dockerize the timvideos conference streaming system
17:36 pdurbin      codex is going to teach me docker some day
17:36 pdurbin      (I hope)
17:36 pdurbin      maybe if I pay him the money I owe him
17:37 skay         hello world is easy (assuming you get docker installed okay)
17:37 skay         I've not written my own thing to get an image that deploys a service -- I cheated and ran a docker build in a repo that makes a container for drone.io
17:38 skay         out of curiosity.
17:38 skay         I stood it up on a rackspace vm and managed to guess how I should write an nginx file to forward requests over to the container so that I could git drone.io. nothing really automated, except for warm fuzzies that I got it to work
17:39 skay         git. that must be a thinko. what the heck typo is that
17:39 skay         we should have a project night goof off session to dockerize our stuff
17:40 skay         too bad it wouldn't be an in person hang out
17:40 skay         I like inpromtu eavesdropping kind of learning
17:43 pdurbin      hangops
17:43 pdurbin      it's a thing, I think
18:55 semiosis     hangops?  sounds violent
18:59 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky hangops

19:48 codex        pdurbin: docker is awesome
19:49 codex        it has simply redefined virtualization
22:39 melodie      codex docker?
23:09 skay         pdurbin: my friend bonnie works at fermilab supporting scientific linux distro stuff
