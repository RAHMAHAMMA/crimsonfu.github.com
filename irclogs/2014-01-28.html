00:03 ijstokes How open is crimsonfu to shameless plugs for an open-access demo I setup for Harvard of a web-based analytics platform?
00:12 pdurbin  ijstokes: isn't one plug enough? ;) http://irclog.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/2014-01-27#i_5694
00:13 pdurbin  ijstokes: plug away, I say :)
00:13 ijstokes Yeah, you inspired me on #dvn.
00:13 ijstokes The demo was iniitally setup just for FAS RC, but we've talked to them and others within Harvard can now check it out if they like.
00:16 semiosis ijstokes: if it's free/open i think the plugs are welcome
04:25 IanSR    semiosis: the demo is free and open, but it is for a commercial product â€¦
14:02 pdurbin  IanSR: so it's a commercial product but there does seem to be a free plan: https://www.wakari.io/plans
14:04 pdurbin  IanSR: the background music is cracking me up :) Using Wakari: The Wakari Life Cycle - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6mxCf8a_rMM#t=0
14:12 pdurbin  anyway, seems like a good way to host IPython Notebooks
