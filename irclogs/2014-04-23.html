19:14 semiosis  hydrajump: re: http://www.staggeringbeauty.com/ -- did you shake vigorously?
19:17 hydrajump semiosis always :P
19:17 semiosis  ha
19:18 hydrajump I sent it to some friends who thought it was a tail :D
19:18 semiosis  it's one of those inflatable dudes from the card dealerships right?
19:18 hydrajump sure...
19:20 semiosis  guess as with any art people can see all kinds of things
19:20 hydrajump yeah like Rorschach test
19:20 hydrajump haha
19:21 hydrajump semiosis you been working on any fun stuff lately?
19:26 semiosis  nope
19:35 semiosis  well, installed dd-wrt on a netgear, going to see if i can run an exotic printer with it
19:35 semiosis  a dnp ds-40
19:36 semiosis  haven't found any embedded devices/print servers than can drive this printer
19:36 semiosis  if dd-wrt doesnt work, next step might be a beaglebone black
19:37 semiosis  already tried openwrt (my preference for netgears) but it lacks the dnp driver as well
19:39 hydrajump Yeah doesn't sound like fun ;)
