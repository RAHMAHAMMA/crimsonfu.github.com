15:00 magoo     agoddard: you around?

18:02 JoeJulian Gah! I have impi boards for a reason... so why won't this one let the keyboard work in grub?!?! &lt;camper class="unhappy"/&gt;
18:33 JoeJulian Dammit selinux... I still am not sure what happened, but I couldn't log in at all. Not via sshd not via the console. I cheated ( "exec { '/usr/bin/systemctl rescue': }" in puppet ) to discover that selinux was the culprit. A quick restorecon and I'm up and running. Was rather pleased with my cheat though. :D
18:41 pdurbin   selinux: the cause of and solution to all of life's problems
23:30 miah      lol
23:30 miah      selinux... its ouch.
23:40 pdurbin   i just leave it disabled these days
23:40 pdurbin   whorka: sorry
23:40 pdurbin   ;)
23:40 JoeJulian mhayden: ^
23:40 pdurbin   JoeJulian: shhh!
23:42 JoeJulian I try to have it enabled as often as possible. Sometimes some system just has to work "right now" so it get disabled, but eventually I come back and add whatever rules or change file contexts as necessary.
23:43 pdurbin   oh, wait, no... my home server is in enforcing. all good
23:43 pdurbin   JoeJulian: call off mhayden
23:44 JoeJulian lol
23:45 pdurbin   JoeJulian: whorka is a master of selinux
23:45 pdurbin   dotplus: he even got RT working with it
