02:55 mhayden   pdurbin: well windows doesn't do acpi_rev properly either
02:55 mhayden   it always reports 2
02:56 mhayden   :(
19:26 semiosis  anyone heard of Boxen?  Used it?  https://boxen.github.com/
19:26 semiosis  looks like puppet scripts to install stuff on your mac
19:28 pdurbin   that might be the one GitHub Inc. uses
19:28 semiosis  it is
19:29 pdurbin   that's all I know
19:53 hydrajump hi guys. anyone familiar with nmap who can double check something for me? Let me know if you're able to determine if any ports are open at the following IP 54.93.216.195
19:54 hydrajump it's an EC2 instance I have launched and want to confirm something.
19:57 larsks    hydrajump: nmap tellsme port 554 and 7070 are open.
19:58 hydrajump hi larsks. that's odd
19:59 larsks    Eh, maybe.  It may simply indicate that my isp is doing something wonky with those ports :)
19:59 hydrajump there's only one port open according to the security group.
19:59 larsks    Is it one of those?
19:59 hydrajump nope
20:00 larsks    Weeeeeeeird.  I can telnet to either port and connect, too.  But no response to anything.
20:01 hydrajump that's really weird
20:02 skay      hey pdurbin, my friend made a channel called #userops http://mediagoblin.org/news/userops.html is it something you'd find interesting?
20:02 larsks    hydrajump: I'm not the only one: http://serverfault.com/questions/330571/nmap-on-my-webserver-shows-tcp-ports-554-and-7070-open
20:06 pdurbin   skay: is it publicly logged like this channel?
20:06 skay      pdurbin: I don't know
20:06 skay      I don't think so. I see nothing about it in the topic
20:07 skay      are any of you at libreplanet?
20:07 * skay    is not
20:08 pdurbin   gonna ski this weekend instead
20:08 skay      oh have fun. I've never downhill skied. cross countried around the lake front before
20:08 skay      s/around/at
20:09 pdurbin   the kids love it
20:10 pdurbin   I slipped on the ice biking to work today. I think the guy who found me thought I was dead.
20:13 whorka    "found" you? holy crap. how long were you out? and you're still going skiing??
20:14 pdurbin   heh. I'm being a drama queen. I just didn't feel like moving until I knew I was ok
20:15 bene      pdurbin: do you ride studs in the winter?
20:15 pdurbin   whorka: ask Cris next to me about the guy she saw wipe out just outside CGIS this morning.
20:15 bene      it was pretty icy this morning
20:16 pdurbin   I probably should ride studs, whatever that means.
20:16 bene      studded bike tires
20:16 pdurbin   sounds fancy
20:16 bene      http://www.peterwhitecycles.com/studdedtires.asp <- Schwalbe Winter Marathons
20:17 bene      that's what i have
20:17 bene      but i'm mostly on the hubway these days
20:19 pdurbin   I want someone to buy me one of those fat tire bikes. Or whatever they're called.
20:20 whorka    a "cruiser" ?
20:21 bene      no, they're called fat bikes
20:21 bene      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fatbike
20:22 whorka    I had Schwalbe Big Apples on my bike for a while which they claimed were "balloon tires"... helped smooth out the ride a bit.
20:23 pdurbin   bene: are you still in the area? let's grab whorka some day and talk bikes over lunch
20:23 bene      i'm downtown for work these days
20:23 bene      but i could WFH some day and trot down for lunch
20:24 pdurbin   now you're talkin'
21:17 hydrajump larsks: ok. thanks for scanning ;)
22:18 pdurbin   skay: now that I've actually read http://mediagoblin.org/news/userops.html I can say, yes, it's interesting. :)
22:18 pdurbin   "If youâ€™re interested in talking about making deployment easier for every-day users, please consider joining the conversation"
22:19 skay      I'm having some pain helping novices learn to deploy something when I'm not an exerpt myself. I just jumped in to help where they have given sudo to maybe everyone?
22:19 pdurbin   skay: did I show you https://github.com/mattl/indieweb-installer/blob/master/dump.md ?
22:19 skay      in production... and they edit the code in production. and push to github from there? sort of? but I don't know how they set things up
22:19 skay      sigh
22:20 skay      pdurbin: you have not
22:20 skay      my friend Asheesh (Chris referred to him) works on sandstorm.io
22:21 skay      seems similar?
22:21 pdurbin   skay: yes, I told Asheesh about it here: http://irclogs.jackgrigg.com/irc.freenode.net/openhatch/2015-01-20#i_3551855
22:21 skay      need to away-from-attention
22:22 skay      pdurbin: oh! I didn't realize you met asheesh. derp. of course you h ave
22:22 skay      I forget who knows everyone
22:22 pdurbin   he's a swell fellow
23:35 bene      if indieweb installer is specifically aimed at webapps, then something in the deis/dokku/flynn camp where it's a heroku-compatible app format seems like a good target
23:35 pdurbin   bene: speak English, man
23:36 bene      if you really want everyone hosting their own little federated web doohickey, then it's got to be low cost and compatible across a bunch of services
23:36 bene      just look up flynn or deis
23:36 bene      do you know about heroku?
23:36 bene      lemme rephrase
23:36 bene      you should know about heroku
23:36 * pdurbin knows about heroku
23:36 bene      :-)
23:37 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky deis dokku flynn
23:37 searchbot pdurbin: http://progrium.com/blog/2014/10/28/deis-breathes-new-life-into-dokku/
23:37 bene      i've only read 3 of the things you've posted from the indieweb crowd
23:37 bene      so i may not have grokked their motivations or goals
23:37 bene      well
23:37 bene      definitely not motivations, but perhaps goals
23:37 pdurbin   'I announced Dokku as an open source "Docker powered mini-Heroku."'
23:38 bene      hmm, flynn looks bigger than i remember
23:38 pdurbin   bene: ok so this thing is like openshift origin. run your own paas
23:39 bene      okay
23:39 bene      i wasn't aware that red hat had open sourced redshift, but yes, that's sounds like a reasonable characterization
23:39 bene      s/red/open
23:39 bene      RedShiftHatOrigin
23:39 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky openshift origin
23:39 searchbot pdurbin: https://www.openshift.com/products/origin
23:39 bene      ShiftHatRedOrigin
23:40 pdurbin   phew! it's still a thing
23:40 bene      yeah, it's a thing
23:40 bene      i went to a talk by nate aune 3-4 years ago comparing heroku, openshift, cloud*mumble* and 1 other PaaS
23:41 pdurbin   I think the indieweb people want something more like CPanel. maybe bear knows
23:41 bene      i saw the cpanel references
23:41 bear      they are not ready for even that level of automation just yet
23:42 bear      the collection of tools is still to variable to really get in place
23:42 pdurbin   well, they should all join that new group skay started :)
23:43 pdurbin   bene: good talk?
23:43 bear      my hunch is that it will be a bunch of microservices with a common  config (but that is also my bias)
23:43 bene      http://appsembler.com/blog/paas-bakeoff-comparing-stackato-openshift-dotcloud-and-heroku-for-django-hosting-and-deployment/ <- stackato and dotcloud were the other two
23:43 bene      it was a good talk
23:44 bene      nate's a good speaker
23:44 bene      he set up the same mini django app on all 4 services
23:44 bear      I would love to see something like Digital Ocean's ability to just paste in a docker file and you get a vm
23:44 bene      showed off the command line tools, etc
23:45 skay      pdurbin: I did not start that group, my friend Chris did
23:45 pdurbin   skay: just joshin' ya
23:45 pdurbin   skay: your friend Chris should join #crimsonfu! :)
23:46 skay      pdurbin: he's paroneayea
23:47 pdurbin   bear: well, how does "
23:47 pdurbin   Docker powered mini-Heroku in around 100 lines of Bash
23:47 pdurbin   " grab ya? https://github.com/progrium/dokku
23:47 bear      add in some sort of default private network configuration... oh my yes
23:47 pdurbin   openstack has fancy virtual networking stuff
23:48 bear      yea, I explored dokku a while ago - but issues with docker was making it fail in odd ways
23:48 bear      well, i'm thinking that someone would need to select "db option 1" and then the remaining items in the deploy bundle would get a network update to allow them to talk to the docker container that is db-option-1
23:50 pdurbin   bear: maybe try running the fancy new linux distro by prologic with all of it's dockerized docker docking: https://github.com/vallinux
23:50 bear      I was reading that this weekend - I just do not have enough time in the day :/
23:51 pdurbin   it's only a week old. good luck running prod on it :)
23:51 bear      LOL
23:53 pdurbin   bene: oh. django hosting. interesting
23:53 pdurbin   bene: in theory I'm maybe going to this: Flask for Django Developers - Django Boston Meetup Group (Cambridge, MA) - Meetup - http://www.meetup.com/djangoboston/events/220624326/
23:54 bene      i'm signed up for that too
23:54 bene      i've been sketching out a little ops-y flask app in recent days
23:55 pdurbin   bene: have an itch to scratch?
23:55 bene      sounds like indiewebcamp wants to productionize tilde.club without the clubby bit
23:56 bene      my itch is that i have SSH access to 700 machines and very little metadata about them
23:56 bene      pssh and for loops can go a long way, but i need to stuff the info i collect into something with an interface that lets me interpret the data in a useful manner
23:56 pdurbin   for the ilbot3, to make a clickable link in the logs: http://tilde.club
23:57 pdurbin   bene: have you tried salt?
23:57 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky salk stack
23:57 searchbot pdurbin: http://saltstack.com/community/
23:57 bene      we have salt in some of the environments
23:57 pdurbin   oh
23:57 bene      have you run halite?
23:57 pdurbin   nope
23:58 pdurbin   bene: you're reminding me of this thing I made while at fasrc: https://github.com/pdurbin/wellington
23:58 bear      you may want to check out the info gathering part of ansible
23:58 pdurbin   but it didn't have a web interface. sounds like you want one
23:58 bear      it runs a small app that then returns a json blob of metadata
23:58 bene      i have run ansible too
23:59 bene      but the reporting bits in tower are not free AFAIK
23:59 bene      and not all of our remote machines have python-simplejson installed
