13:48 melodie hi
13:49 melodie I'd like to ask if someone knows WHDD and could give me some insights? I used it but didn't quite understand all the details it seems
13:49 melodie this is the tool: http://whdd.org/demo/
14:13 pdurbin melodie: I've never heard of it but it looks like it fixes hard drives
14:13 melodie hi pdurbin
14:14 melodie Happy End of Year!
14:14 pdurbin :)
14:14 pdurbin melodie: you too
14:15 melodie thanks!
14:16 melodie I would need to have details about that whdd : what does it do exactly when it uses the "copy" mode?
14:16 melodie why does the guy who did the video use /dev/null as destination for his file,
14:16 melodie ?
14:16 melodie what kind of filetype does it do? I tried to do a file and it ended with zero byte
14:23 melodie if anyone has answers later, I'll be around to read
14:23 melodie :)
14:26 pdurbin melodie: you might want to try the "users" list at http://whdd.org/contact/
14:27 melodie oh ho ! I missed that?
14:28 melodie pdurbin thank you. :)

20:48 melodie itrs 21:48:39 here
20:49 pdurbin I'm trying fedup to upgrade from Fedora 19 to 20: https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/FedUp
20:50 pdurbin what could possibly go wrong? :)
20:53 melodie anything could go wrong :)
21:37 melodie I'am trying to translate a sentence, not even sure I understand it in English. What does that mean? "To ensure your Preferential Jigoshop Partner Rates, please complete your (...)"
21:37 melodie if someone can help...
21:39 pdurbin man this takes a while
21:39 pdurbin melodie: sounds like you're getting a special rate. a discount
21:44 melodie :)
21:45 melodie what's a shopper? Is it the customer? the one who performs shopping?
21:45 melodie pdurbin> melodie: sounds like you're getting a special rate. a discount || now I get it!
21:45 melodie thanks

21:56 melodie looking
21:56 melodie so it's almost like the word "buyer"?
21:57 pdurbin yeah
21:57 melodie great!
22:08 pdurbin done! Fedora 20
22:12 pdurbin good lord I still have this problem: F17 cursor crazy - https://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/users/2013-February/431969.html :(
22:24 pdurbin hmm, actually, maybe it is better :)
22:29 melodie pdurbin I would say some dirt inside the mouse?
22:30 melodie "What is it, and how do I turn it back off??"
22:30 melodie he fun, he doesn't know what he did, and he expects other to know. :}
22:31 melodie others*
22:31 pdurbin no mouse. just a trackpad
22:32 melodie can't that get dust inside?
22:32 melodie autoclick has never been a feature, not even one that I heard about so far! XD
22:32 pdurbin not a feature
22:32 pdurbin :)
22:33 melodie did you meet with that with F17 and or other versions published after?
22:34 melodie that must drive some mad!
22:34 pdurbin actually, i think it's still happening... :(
22:35 pdurbin all I'm doing is hovering my cursor over a different window... a window other than gnome-terminal (where I'm typing into weechat)
22:36 pdurbin I hover the cursor over firefox, for example
22:36 pdurbin then I walk away from this laptop
22:36 pdurbin and sometimes, when I come back, firefox has focus as if it's been clicked
22:37 pdurbin my workaround has been to keep the cursor over gnome-terminal but that's ridiculous
22:37 pdurbin the clicks shouldn't happen on their own
22:48 pdurbin it drives me crazy
22:50 pdurbin hmm, I still have gnome-classic-session and its dependencies I listed at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2013-06-21#i_7231553
