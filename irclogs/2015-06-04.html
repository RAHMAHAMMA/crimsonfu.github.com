12:08 pdurbin just picked up my tote bag: http://www.centerdigitaled.com/events/Harvard-University-IT-Summit-2015.html?page=agenda
12:44 dotplus have fun
13:13 pdurbin I'll bring my laptop it case it isn't ;)
13:26 bene    ooh, get me one
13:27 pdurbin heh
13:35 bene    heh, piotr got an sbgrid presentation on the slate
13:42 bene    lastpass for everyone?
13:42 pdurbin meh. symmetrically gpg-encrypted file for me :)
13:49 bene    okay, but you're a geek and presumably anal enough to have good habits around key management and tmp files for editors and all the rest
13:49 bene    it's not reasonable to ask all staff to do that
13:50 pdurbin all the staff people I asked to do that no longer hang out in this channel but semiosis knows them :)
13:51 bene    it's more interesting to me that huit security presumably vetted a bunch of password managers and picked lastpass
13:51 bene    good advertising for them
13:53 bene    also, gpg as a technology is incredibly useful
13:53 bene    and as an implementation, sucks donkey butt
14:03 larsks  bene++ re: gpg implementation.  A constant source of frustration for, like, 20 years.
14:19 pdurbin these people are trying to make it easier: https://botbot.me/freenode/opensourcedesign/2015-04-20/?msg=37035853&page=1
19:55 larsks  pdurbin: that looks like a pretty sketchy page.  It looks like one of the hundreds of other "...the goal of this project is to..." web pages that litter the graveyards of the web :).  And they have a link to a nonexistent twitter account.
20:04 pdurbin !
20:04 pdurbin they mean well :)
20:30 * bene  mutters something about the road to hell
20:34 pdurbin :)
