16:47 pdurbin      as opposed to Apple, where the people designing the latest iPhone wear the pants
16:47 pdurbin      that was how I heard it anyway
17:38 pdurbin      thinks*
18:09 pdurbin      ok, here's the actual quote (from 28:10): "The real heart (if you dig down) of Google are the people who run the infrastructure that run all their services. Those are the real sort of little Yodas inside Google, the people with the most respect and clout and power and the ability to say no to your project and yes to your project indirectly."
18:13 pdurbin      which reminds me of this comment by Google developer Thor Mitchell: "The cost of maintaining and supporting a feature is a function of how much ongoing work it will generate for operations teams" -- https://plus.google.com/+JulianBond23/posts/4mLaNh31JcW
19:17 melodie      does someone here know the losetup tool?
19:18 melodie      I'd like some insights about  how to use it the right way
19:19 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky losetup
19:19 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://www.linuxcommand.org/man_pages/losetup8.html

21:29 melodie      pdurbin WHDD successful to retrieve the full hard drive
21:29 melodie      then mounted with losetup and kpartx, this way:
21:29 melodie      http://pastebin.fr/32148
21:29 melodie      now I have to do a serious "fsck.ext4" against the partition file number 4
21:30 melodie      what options should I use? I think "-y" because I don't want it interactive, and what else could be good?
21:30 melodie      if someone here reads me a and knows, that would be nice!
22:07 pdurbin      melodie: you are recovering some data?
22:09 melodie      pdurbin yes, partitions exactly
22:09 melodie      with WHDD: http://whdd.org
22:52 pdurbin      -y makes sense
23:05 melodie      http://pastebin.fr/32149
23:05 melodie      did -f -y
23:06 melodie      all worked!
23:06 melodie      now I need a hard drive.... XD
23:06 melodie      don't have any spare one as sata
23:06 melodie      need to buy one
23:07 melodie      i've got a ata but it's also old with several prefail messages when reading from smartmontool
