11:42 pdurbin yeah, semiosis has mentioned logstash for irc logging. or I guess analysis. if anyone wants to shove the #crimsonfu logs into logstash they're at http://crimsonfu.github.io/irclogs
14:26 melodie hi
14:29 pdurbin hi
14:59 pdurbin melodie: I'm so sorry for your data loss :( http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2013-05-19
15:00 pdurbin I hope you didn't lose any of *my* posts! ;)
15:00 pdurbin ben_e: I'm still so happy about the database dump mirror. thanks again
15:01 melodie pdurbin I don't know if there is data loss yet, we will see that when the forum will be again online
15:01 melodie this is a lottery...
15:20 pdurbin oh. good
15:28 melodie very bad, who knows if they are even going to put the websites online successfully? Maybe their new machine is going to dye too. they didn't explain enough about what happened, so it's not possible to get the slightest idea about what went wrong and why it will go better later
16:24 pdurbin :(
