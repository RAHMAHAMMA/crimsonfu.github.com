02:55 sivoais   did not know about Auto Awesome. I'm looking at all the things it does...cool use of computer vision.
11:51 pdurbin   sivoais: oh, sounds like you found a nice write up of it

17:25 hydrajump pdurbin interesting projects
17:50 pdurbin   hydrajump: I thought so
17:50 pdurbin   mhayden: I'm looking at your http://major.io/2013/08/24/get-a-rock-solid-linux-touchpad-configuration-for-the-lenovo-x1-carbon/
17:51 pdurbin   which led me to look at my /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/50-synaptics.conf which says "Some devices have the buttons as part of the lower edge of the touchpad.  Pressing a button moves the cursor, causing cursor jumps and erroneous clicks."
17:52 pdurbin   erroneous clicks?!? that sounds like ME! and the laptop with Fedora on it I keep complaining about in here
17:55 pdurbin   mhayden: rather than an X1 Carbon I have a X220 Tablet but it's still a Lenovo, a Thinkpad
19:37 pdurbin   huh. I have a crazy theory now that the problem is somehow related to having my laptop plugged into power or not
21:27 sivoais   didn't see a write up, but looked at this G+ Help page <https://support.google.com/plus/answer/3113884>
