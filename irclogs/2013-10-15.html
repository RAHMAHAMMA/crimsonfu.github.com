16:47 pdurbin I'm confused. https://github.com/swordapp/JavaServer2.0/pull/2 and https://github.com/swordapp/JavaServer2.0/pull/3 were both merged but only pull 3 (mine from 2 months ago) shows up at https://github.com/swordapp/JavaServer2.0/commits/master
16:53 pdurbin as far as I know, the two pull requests are incompatible. maybe one overwrote the other?
