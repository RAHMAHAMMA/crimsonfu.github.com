19:20 shuff    something went wrong!
19:21 pdurbin  i hate it when something goes wrong

20:19 shuff    SEJeff: ?
20:20 SEJeff   Thats a hands up gesture, kind of like for a touchdown.
20:21 SEJeff   gridiron is one of the SAs who pokes until something breaks
20:21 SEJeff   me too
20:21 shuff    aha
20:24 pdurbin  \o/ for victory, per wikipedia
