03:31 * pdurbin looks at https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/SysVinit_to_Systemd_Cheatsheet
13:39 pdurbin   semiosis: I'm trying. It's hard: http://irclog.greptilian.com/javaee/2014-02-26#i_60264
17:01 semiosis  pdurbin: my friendly advice for you: unless you have ops & can kick everyone out, stay out of it
17:02 semiosis  if that kinda thing happened in #gluster i would not have hesitated kicking all involved
17:02 semiosis  as i have done before with people spewing hate
17:14 pdurbin   semiosis: I'm just the guy who logs the channel. I don't want to be involved in kicking people
17:15 semiosis  pdurbin: log link should be in the /topic btw, not sure if it is in ##javaee.
17:15 semiosis  not that i care much either way, but if people know they're being logged they may behave better :(
17:15 semiosis  sad fact of life
17:27 pdurbin   semiosis: the link to the logs is in the topic. always has been
17:28 semiosis  oh well then i guess there's no helping those fools
17:28 semiosis  that was me being optimistic
17:29 semiosis  this is why i left ##infra-talk... no public logs & lots of ad hominem
17:52 pdurbin   overall, ##javaee has been a successful experiment. for me anyway
17:52 pdurbin   so has #crimsonfu for that matter :)
22:32 pdurbin   semiosis: one more thought about ugliness in ##javaee
22:33 semiosis  ??
22:33 pdurbin   it's logged at http://irclog.greptilian.com/javaee/today
22:33 pdurbin   that's my website
22:33 pdurbin   and I'm a believer in this: http://dashes.com/anil/2011/07/if-your-websites-full-of-assholes-its-your-fault.html
22:34 pdurbin   when people make ##javaee ugly they make my website ugly
22:34 pdurbin   which I don't like
22:34 pdurbin   so I do what I can
22:34 pdurbin   to keep the ugliness off my site
