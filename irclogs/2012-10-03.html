15:00 pdurbin      ah, curl -L
15:01 pdurbin      thanks, crimsonfubot
15:29 pdurbin      Itkovian: know anything about http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORQUE_Resource_Manager ?
15:29 Itkovian     pdurbin: we're using that
15:29 pdurbin      \o/
15:29 Itkovian     together wioth Moab
15:31 pdurbin      linking some guys here :) hopefully they'll /join
15:37 pdurbin      Itkovian: is it awesome?
15:37 Itkovian     it works
15:37 Itkovian     well, except for 4.x, there are some issues with that version :-p
15:37 pdurbin      tell me about your troubles
15:40 semiosis     @channelstats
15:40 crimsonfubot semiosis: Error: "channelstats" is not a valid command.
15:40 semiosis     :(
15:40 pdurbin      semiosis: @ is a shortcut for crimsonfubot
15:41 pedmon       yo
15:41 pdurbin      pedmon: welcome!
15:41 semiosis     yeah, and channelstats is a command for crimsonfubot, when the channelstats plugin is loaded :)
15:41 pdurbin      semiosis: oh
15:41 semiosis     @load channelstats
15:41 crimsonfubot semiosis: Error: You don't have the owner capability. If you think that you should have this capability, be sure that you are identified before trying again. The 'whoami' command can tell you if you're identified.
15:41 semiosis     crimsonfubot: i know, i know
15:41 pdurbin      semiosis: ssh! let's talk schedulers
15:41 crimsonfubot semiosis: Error: "i" is not a valid command.
15:41 semiosis     haha
15:42 semiosis     schedulers?
15:43 pdurbin      Itkovian: you like schedulers
15:43 pdurbin      pedmon: so do you
15:44 Itkovian     I do?
15:44 Itkovian     I said we use it
15:44 pdurbin      heh
15:45 pedmon       true schedulers are awesome... :P
15:45 pedmon       more like a necessary evil
15:46 pedmon       we use LSF here
15:46 pedmon       what do other people use?
15:47 pdurbin      "Cluster Resources, Inc. describes it as open-source" wtf. "describes it as"? from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TORQUE_Resource_Manager
15:47 pdurbin      whorka: you have a scheduler. but you're idle according to pidgin
15:48 pdurbin      semiosis: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Job_scheduler
15:50 semiosis     right
15:54 pdurbin      Itkovian: no plans to change schedulers, i assume?
15:54 Itkovian     nope
15:54 pdurbin      that's probably praise enough :)
16:05 whorka       oh, hey. back from a meeting. Condor scheduler representing here.
16:05 Itkovian     we're quite happy with moab
16:05 pdurbin      whorka: you stickin' with condor?
16:05 Itkovian     and their support is good enough
16:05 whorka       Condor fits our present use case pretty well.
16:08 pdurbin      i'm actually confused about moab vs. torque. but i can go look it up
16:09 pdurbin      oh! oh! you schedulers guys should all subscribe to this podcast: RCE an HPC Podcast - http://www.rce-cast.com
16:09 pdurbin      whorka: great name, eh? ;)
16:10 Itkovian     pdurbin: torque is what allocates resources and it uses moab to decide which jobs to schedule at what time
16:11 pdurbin      hmm, ok. so you pretty much need both
16:11 whorka       oh they have a HUBzero! I wanted to try that.
16:12 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky hubzero
16:12 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://hubzero.org/
17:57 pdurbin      "P.s. You are indeed a hacker -- I mean the good way. Cool!" :)
18:56 pdurbin      boegel: you missed a bit of chatter about schedulers :) ^^
18:58 * boegel     dives into the logs
18:59 * boegel     is back
19:00 boegel       pdurbin: Torque has a (dummy) scheduler too, but its rubbish
19:00 boegel       pdurbin: there's Maui too, which is the open-source version of MOAB
19:00 pdurbin      ah. yeah i was wondering if there was some lesser built in feature
19:00 boegel       pdurbin: it's sufficient for small systems, where you don't need to be fancy stuff
19:00 boegel       pdurbin: but in the end, you probably end up with MOAB
19:00 boegel       pdurbin: I think Torque only features a FIFO scheduler
19:01 pdurbin      hmm. ok
19:01 boegel       pdurbin: Maui is reasonable, but badly supported
19:02 pdurbin      it's 2012. you're a new HPC shop. you need a scheduler. what do you use? go :)
19:04 boegel       I've never seen anything but Torque+MOAB
19:04 boegel       so I'd go for that
19:04 boegel       they're really good, but not free of problems
19:05 boegel       Torque 4.x is a rewrite of 3.x, and we've had some issues with that, but it still works pretty good
19:05 pdurbin      cool. thanks
20:55 pdurbin      shuff: email is where knowledge goes to die according to http://bfrench.info/public/item/5994 - https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/16X8Hoq2eGk
23:04 Itkovian     pdurbin: actually, iirc, Torque does come with a pretty simple default scheduler or something that tries to be a scheduler -- we're using that when we had an issue with Moab on a clusters that's in pilot -- not sure if it does anything besides FIFO :-)
