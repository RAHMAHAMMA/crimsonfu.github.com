12:30 dotplus   ha. buzzword bingo(psych) triggered just in the URL.
12:46 pdurbin   too much buzzword?
12:46 pdurbin   I dunno, seems interesting. I may check out the original paper.
13:32 dotplus   quite possibly interesting, just that the URL made me twitch:)
14:17 * pdurbin was a psych major
14:53 bene      it's IRODS all the way DOWN
14:57 hydrajump larsks I've been trying to get termshare to work but not successful yet. The instructions are a bit thin. I managed to deploy it to heroku, but I can't access the web-based terminal. The heroku app url redirects to the github project repo. I've contacted the author via twitter, but so far I've not got it to work. You tried it?
14:58 larsks    hydrajump: Not yet.  It's on my short list :). What I *really* want is something that integrates directly with tmux, so that I can run "tmux" locally but hook it up to some sort of web-based broadcasting mechanism.
14:59 hydrajump I've seen something like that but I don't use tmux... one sec
14:59 hydrajump larsks http://tmate.io/
15:01 larsks    You had my hopes up! :) But that seems more targeted at remote paring.  I want the web-based aspect for doing demos without requiring software installs for participants.  I see that they have "HTML 5 client" on their "future work" list, so I will keep my eye on it.
15:08 hydrajump larsks do you run your znc, tapchat services on a cloud server?
15:09 larsks    hydrajump: Yeah, I'm using digitalocean for that.
15:10 hydrajump cool
15:12 hydrajump digitalocean seems quite popular
16:00 pdurbin   bene: you know about https://irods.org ?
16:00 pdurbin   it's on our roadmap: http://thedata.org/book/upcoming-releases
16:01 pdurbin   "after 4.0" :)
16:08 bene      yes, i'm familiar with irods
16:10 pdurbin   wow. that's two people in one week
16:11 bene      this rob ford crack video goes out to _you_ and _you_ and _you_!
16:11 bene      the high energy physics crowd has been dealing with big data far longer than most sciences
16:11 pdurbin   the other guy was at this event (I'm mentioned in the blog post): http://openhatch.org/blog/2014/openhatch-newsletter-april-2014/
16:12 bene      and i'm an HEP RC dilletante
16:12 bene      i have also heard jacob farmer pitch his starfish FS metadata system in the past
16:12 bene      BioIT world is this week
16:13 bene      so all this stuff is popping up in my twitter feed right now
16:16 dotplus   HEP == High Energy Physics? That sounds like a dangerous business to be dilletante about
16:17 bene      i'm only a dilletante about the research computing aspects
16:17 dotplus   heh, less dangerous then.
16:23 dotplus   pdurbin: has anyone from dataverse talked to any of the open research folks here @ornl.gov? it seems that there might be people on both sides that would be interested in getting together if they were made aware of each other
16:25 pdurbin   orly.gov? ;)
16:25 pdurbin   "No messages matched your search." ... nothing in my email
16:26 pdurbin   dotplus: ask them to say hi: https://groups.google.com/group/dataverse-community :)
16:28 dotplus   I don't even know who "them" is. there are ~5k people here. But next time I hear someone going on about how much we're contributing to the body of (public) scientific research, I'll point them at dataverse
16:30 pdurbin   dotplus: I have something you should point them at... one sec
16:31 pdurbin   open science channels - Google Groups - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/openscienceframework/wb0dkThdeJ8
16:31 pdurbin   dotplus: ^^
16:32 pdurbin   yay science
16:46 hydrajump can you PM someone on IRC even if you don't know what channel(s) they might be on?
16:49 pdurbin   hydrajump: sure. with /query hydrajump or whatever
16:50 hydrajump thanks pdurbin
16:55 semiosis  pdurbin: converting the vboxes to qemu/kvm now
16:56 semiosis  too many startup/shutdown issues with vbox
17:02 pdurbin   semiosis: the author of vagrant seems to prefer vmware over vbox
17:02 semiosis  what?
17:02 semiosis  link?
17:02 semiosis  vmw isnt even open source
17:03 pdurbin   semiosis: it was on some podcast
17:20 semiosis  wow kvm was a lot easier to set up than i remember
17:23 semiosis  amazed how vbox can handle suspend/resume so well but fails miserably with plain old shutdown/startup
17:24 pdurbin   shutdown? I always just run `vagrant destroy` :)
17:27 bene      i have 30+ vbox VMs running on a headless server
17:27 bene      we use them for software build/testing
17:28 bene      the software opengl implementation under vbox was much better than kvm when i originally built it
18:04 pdurbin   bene: how do you manage those vbox VMs? with vagrant?
18:06 bene      http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpvirtualbox/
18:07 pdurbin   huh
18:07 bene      very slick web frontend to the vboxwebsrv
18:19 semiosis  bene: i was using remotebox (remotebox.knobgoblin.org.uk)
18:19 semiosis  which was also pretty slick
18:20 bene      yeah, i saw the oblique reference and read the irc log to find out the rest
18:39 pdurbin   jabrcx: wow. nice redesign: https://rc.fas.harvard.edu
18:40 jabrcx    thanks to Aaron Kitzmiller and Gabrielle Naglieri
18:41 pdurbin   ah
18:41 pdurbin   jabrcx: I had linked to it here: http://irclogs.jackgrigg.com/irc.freenode.net/openhatch/2014-05-01#i_3343575
18:44 jabrcx    cool!
18:51 pdurbin   :)
18:57 hydrajump larsks just tested termshare. Couldn't get my own server working, but using the free service it works great!
18:58 hydrajump Super easy to use. Execute termshare on the machine you want to share. Share the URL that shows and the other user can see your shell from a web browser AND control if you want
