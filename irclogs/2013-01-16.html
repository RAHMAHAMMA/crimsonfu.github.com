14:14 jimi_c  rackerhacker: I was searching for a mysql tuning guide yesterday and stumbled across one of your blog posts - i was amused :)
14:16 pdurbin it's a small world
14:17 pdurbin speaking of mysql, i went to this talk last night: Java and Elasticity:Scaling Java Apps with Elastic Database Virtualization - The Boston Java Meetup Group (Cambridge, MA) - Meetup - http://www.meetup.com/boston-java/events/93509602/
14:17 pdurbin by the founder of ParElastic | Elastic Database Virtualization for the Cloud - http://www.parelastic.com/
14:18 pdurbin their solution reminds be somewhat of glusterfs
14:18 jimi_c  so, we're running mysql on vmware, i'm currently wondering if it's worth looking into some EC2 style tricks to improve performance, like allocating multiple vm disks and doing a software raid set on them
14:19 jimi_c  i tried a couple of tuning options from the mysql performance blog and it caused iowait to go way up (30%+)
14:19 jimi_c  namely the innodb flush O_DIRECT option
14:20 jimi_c  i may be on later to pick some brains
14:30 pdurbin that's what we're here for
