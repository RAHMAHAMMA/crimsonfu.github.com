16:09 ironcamel pdurbin: Whenever I see php and perl mentioned together, I feel obligated to point out that the first version of php was a perl script.
16:09 ironcamel A poorly written perl script from what I have heard.
16:09 pdurbin   that's hilarious. yes, it rings a bell. . . but i had forgotten :)
16:13 pdurbin   http://news.php.net/php.internals/46876 php.internals: Re: About optimization ("PHP as primarily a C API for extending the web server" --Rasmus Lerdorf)
16:13 pdurbin   i've always found that quote from the creator of PHP interesting
16:14 pdurbin   he doesn't mention perl in the early days. but i think you're right
16:15 ironcamel http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Php
16:15 ironcamel PHP development began in 1994 when the Danish/Greenlandic/Canadian programmer Rasmus Lerdorf initially created a set of Perl scripts he called "Personal Home Page Tools" to maintain his personal homepage.
16:17 pdurbin   [citation needed] ;)

19:34 pdurbin   this ticket i mentioned at lunch. the one i opened: new package Authen::Passphrase https://github.com/repoforge/rpms/issues/120
19:35 pdurbin   hmm, i guess i could have mentioned perl in the title... does ruby use :: too?
19:35 shuff     yes
19:35 pdurbin   such a copycat
19:50 pdurbin   shuff: xapian-omega ( http://xapian.org/docs/omega/ ) is the search tool i'm now using (with ikiwiki) if you want to let rob and eric know
19:50 shuff     got it
19:50 shuff     i have looked at xapian before
19:50 shuff     thx
19:50 pdurbin   i emailed a couple fedora people about it today. hoping for a package some day
20:09 pdurbin   and a pony
23:24 ironcamel pdurbin: why not just install Authen::Passphrase via cpan?
