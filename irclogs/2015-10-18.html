13:47 pdurbin     hydrajump: cool. I can't seem to find them on freenode or gitter though. I wonder if they have a presence on either.
13:56 pdurbin     ah, they do. they're on gitter: https://gitter.im/mattermost/platform/archives/2015/10/18
13:57 pdurbin     makes sense. it's a chat platform after all :)
15:18 bene_______ no mobile clients yet
15:18 bene_______ i was looking at it the other day
15:18 larsks      gitter has an irc interface of sorts...
15:18 larsks      ...so that could be your mobile client :)
15:21 bene_       it doesn't look like they use gitter at all
15:21 bene_       phil's the only person to have commented in the last month that i can see
15:27 bene_       also it's a chat application, so shouldn't they be dogfooding?
15:27 bene_       gitter strikes me as a service only pdurbin could love :-)
16:04 pdurbin     bene_: you don't like gitter?!? why not? :)
19:25 pdurbin     I guess I should marry it.
