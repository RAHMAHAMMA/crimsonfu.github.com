21:19 pdurbin  wow, sounds like running openstack on centos was pretty rough in january 2011: Blake Yeager - Deployment Strategies - OpenStack Austin Meetup - December 8th, 2011 http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RtvegVNnJ_4#t=3m42s
21:19 pdurbin  and that most people continue to run openstack on ubuntu
21:35 pdurbin  hmm, this video talks about how much intelligence is expected to be built into the web applications built on top of openstack. OpenStack Basics - Overview: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1GFoY4btpo
21:37 pdurbin  ... that the design of openstack assumes some openstack components can fail and that the web application can deal with the failure
21:53 pdurbin  nice that that video is linked from http://wiki.openstack.org/DemoVideos
21:55 pdurbin  hmm, "XFS is considered to be the best option" -- http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Swift_Object_Server-d1e291.html
22:05 pdurbin  woof, this is starting to get a bit involved... http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Nova_conf-d2s367.html
22:06 pdurbin  sudo mkfs.xfs -i size=1024 /dev/sdb1
22:07 pdurbin  yeah, definitely pushing xfs: http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Swift_configuration.html
22:09 pdurbin  "string that can never change (DO NOT LOSE)" heh. http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Swift_hash_configuration.html
22:14 pdurbin  "Sometimes you may have XXX instead of the smiley" heh. http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Nova_Components_nova-compute_alone_-d1e1123.html
22:21 pdurbin  i have to agree with sjoeboo's comments from friday that all this image creation seems like a pain compared to kickstart: http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/OS_Installation-d1e1298.html
22:35 pdurbin  "Currently we assume that all images have a kernel image and a ramdisk. Modern hypervisors on modern VMs can run raw disk images, without the complexity of a separate ramdisk/kernel image" https://blueprints.launchpad.net/nova/+spec/raw-disk-images
22:42 pdurbin  shuff: i know you like Eucalyptus. you'll be happy to see openstack uses its command line tool: http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Euca2ools-Command_Line_Tools-d1e1828.html
22:44 pdurbin  euca-get-console-output. nice
22:46 pdurbin  hmm. "The storage on the instances is non persistent in nature and hence any data that you generate and store on the file system on the first disk of the instance gets lost when the instance is terminated."
22:47 pdurbin  "You will need to use persistent volumes provided by nova-volume if you want any data generated during the life of the instance to persist after the instance is terminated." http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Nova-volume-d1e2000.html
22:48 pdurbin  it's not clear to me how to persist the VMs, which seems rather important
22:52 pdurbin  Q: "How to make a vm persistent?" https://answers.launchpad.net/nova/+question/149350 A: "You need to bundle your running instance, upload it and register it to create a new image."
22:54 pdurbin  gonna have to ask westmaas about that one... coming from vmware and kvm, we're used to our
22:54 pdurbin  VMs being persistent
22:58 pdurbin  "Nova stores the data related to the projects, users, resources etc. in a database, by default in a MySQL database." mysql by default, i guess. http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Database_Management-d1e2713.html
22:59 pdurbin  still not clear to me what a "project" is. not really defined at http://docs.openstack.org/diablo/openstack-compute/starter/content/Project_Management-d1e2672.html
23:01 pdurbin  the networking section is pretty light. basically just a pointer to http://docs.openstack.org/openstack-compute/admin/content/ch04.html
23:02 pdurbin  ah, at least that page says "A Compute project consists of a number of VM instances created by a user"
23:04 westmaas yeah, the idea is you can have multiple users with access to the same project
23:04 westmaas its basically an auth boundary
23:04 pdurbin  oh hey, westmaas :)
23:04 westmaas :)
23:05 pdurbin  i thought i was talking to myself
23:05 pdurbin  i thought i had invented a new form of blogging :)
23:05 westmaas do you care about data being persisted after you delete an instance?
23:05 westmaas haha
23:05 westmaas or only being there after reboots, and the like.
23:05 pdurbin  well, delete sounds so. . . final
23:06 pdurbin  what if i shutdown a vm for a while
23:06 pdurbin  and someone complains
23:06 pdurbin  so i turn it back on
23:06 pdurbin  is the vm as-is?
23:06 westmaas yeah, that'd be fine.
23:06 westmaas I think openstack does support amazon style ephemeral instances, but I don't really know anything about that.
23:07 westmaas by defaults our instances are more permanent
23:07 pdurbin  ok. good
23:07 pdurbin  uh oh, wife and kids coming up the stairs
23:07 pdurbin  at least i finished that intro doc
23:07 westmaas haha
23:07 westmaas cool
23:08 westmaas also jan 2011 is soooo long ago :)
23:08 westmaas That's before my team started on the project!
