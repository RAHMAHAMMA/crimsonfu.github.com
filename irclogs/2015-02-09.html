17:20 semiosis   pdurbin: chromecast!  i use it with google play music all access.  it's amazing
17:23 bear       chromecast and roku is what I use
17:23 bear       the latest roku has a usb port for external devices
17:47 pdurbin    what if I buy a laptop that has a DVD player (non-Apple, these days). Can I send the DVN audio/video via the Chromecast to the TV/projector?
17:48 semiosis   no
17:48 bear       chromecast is the receiver so unless the dvd can be played in a browser - no
17:48 bear       that's why plex is so useful
17:50 pdurbin    hmm. well, I need a way to get a DVD signal to the big screen/stereo. right now I plug a DVD player into my projector with svideo and into the stero with those normal right/white left/right connectors for audio
17:50 bene       you can airplay the dvd from an os x machine with a dvd player
17:50 bene       if you're really going to use dvds as the source, you should just buy a dvd player
17:51 semiosis   i use a receiver to switch between hdmi inputs.  one has the chromecast, one has a long cable for my laptop, one has my old desktop pc which i use for DVDs
17:51 semiosis   that's nice because i can use the chromecast with the speakers without having the TV on (it heats up the room)
17:51 bene       they're like $25
17:52 pdurbin    hmm. well, OS X machines with DVD players are disappearing. I guess I could plug an external DVD thing into a modern Apple machine that lacks an optical drive. but that's more wires and the requirements state that there should be as few wires as possible. preferrably none. :)
17:52 bene       given the simplicity and "just works" requirement, if the sources are dvds, you should buy a dvd player
17:53 bene       4 star models with 1000+ reviews for $25 on amazon
17:54 bear       i've wanted to explore hooking up a usb dvd player to a roku
17:54 bene       why would you not connect it directly to the tv?
17:54 pdurbin    I don't have a TV. I have an old projector.
17:54 bene       same thing
17:55 bene       if the projector only has 1 input, then you need to get an av receiver
17:55 bene       these are first world problems
17:55 semiosis   i guess pdurbin wants something to split the audio out before going into the projector
17:55 pdurbin    yeah, like semiosis is talking about
17:55 semiosis   hence my hdmi switching receiver
17:55 bear       hdmi switching receiver solves a *lot* of small problems
17:56 semiosis   i was lucky to find a clearance sale by sherbourn and picked up a very high end receiver (though an older model) brand new for cheap
17:56 pdurbin    it's almost like the desire is that all the "switching" would be done by using different apps on a laptop. stick a DVD in and play it. open up netflix in a browser and play it. open iphoto and look at some pictures. ideally, there is no receiver, it would seem
17:57 bene       so apple tv then and airplay
17:57 bene       mirror your desktop to the projector and run whatever audio/video you like
17:57 semiosis   i really like being able to control the music through chromecast from the google play app on the phone
17:57 semiosis   that's a killer app imho
17:57 bene       use airparrot for $20 to connect a windows machine to the atv
17:58 bene       ah, you can do that with the chromecast too i think
17:58 bene       play a chrome tab to the device?
17:59 pdurbin    bene: I think that's right. Apple TV + AirPlay. No desktops though, I guess. Has to be a laptop, I think. And I don't think I can buy a new MacBook with an optical drive.
17:59 bene       no
18:00 bene       you can't buy any apple model with a built in optical drive these days
18:00 pdurbin    right
18:00 semiosis   pdurbin: get a mac mini, external dvd drive, wireless keyboard & mouse.  there you go.
18:00 pdurbin    semiosis: yeah, maybe that
18:00 semiosis   wireless keyboard & mouse is way better than handling a laptop
18:01 semiosis   logitech makes a nice, cheap, keyboard with touchpad
18:01 semiosis   batteries last for ever
18:02 pdurbin    so if I go the mac mini route, I guess I don't need a chromecast
18:02 semiosis   or the hdmi switching receiver
18:02 pdurbin    yeah. would need an apple tv for airplay
18:02 semiosis   although you'd need some way to get the audio out.  perhaps a usb audio interface
18:03 pdurbin    I think airplay does audio.
18:03 bene       naw, just connect the mini straight to the projector
18:03 bene       skip the airplay bit entirely and make everything more reliable
18:03 semiosis   bene: where do the speakers plug in then?
18:03 semiosis   prjector audio output?
18:03 bene       to the mini
18:04 pdurbin    bene: yeah, you're right
18:04 bene       or the projector if it can take hdmi audio
18:04 bene       not sure minis have hdmi directly actually
18:04 semiosis   they do
18:04 semiosis   but headphone jack audio?  yuck
18:04 pdurbin    I guess for now I could even keep the current projector. buy a dongle to downgrade whatever comes out of the mac mini into VGA or svideo
18:05 semiosis   they make hdmi converters that give you digitial audio output + vga
18:05 semiosis   never tried one, but it might do the trick
18:05 pdurbin    semiosis: I have a requirement to get rid of the large receiver anyway. Yucky but headphone jack audio will probably be ok.
18:06 semiosis   yeah, i guess.  i'm a bit of an audiophile so i went a bit overboard to get excellent audio quality
18:06 bene       apple specs say that minijack out on the mini can do digital out
18:06 semiosis   ooh nice!
18:06 semiosis   imho a good DAC is the most important component for sound quality
18:07 pdurbin    I don't know that *I* would be thrilled about controlling this whole "experience" via a keyboard and mouse but whatever. :) I'd probably optimize for control via a phone or tablet. Oh well. Requirements are requirements. :)
18:07 bene       http://www.neyrinck.com/news/96-tech-blog-mac-headphone-optical-digital-audio-output
18:09 semiosis   pdurbin: controlling a computer with a remote is a pain.  gotta map the keys for all your apps, etc.
18:10 bene       http://www.amazon.ca/Velocity-Digital-Optical-Cable-Mini-Jack/dp/B0002JFN10 <- good pic of the cable
18:10 bene       i've never seen one of those
18:10 semiosis   i have a dac that uses that connector for optical input.  it came with a mini to standard toslink adapter.
18:10 bene       so if you poke your mac in the right place, it will shoot a laser at you
18:12 pdurbin    semiosis: yeah
18:15 pdurbin    I wonder if you can buy an external bluray player that hooks into a mac mini.
18:19 semiosis   any usb bluray should work, right?
18:19 pdurbin    bear: the idea of hooking a dvd player to a roku via usb is interesting
18:19 bene       i have an external blu ray drive for my mini
18:19 pdurbin    bene: cool. just thinking of future requirements :)
18:19 bear       yea, just to see if the hacked version of plex that is behind the roku interface will grok it

21:22 hydrajump  semiosis: yep
21:22 hydrajump  for iOS
21:22 semiosis   how awesome is it?
21:23 hydrajump  very! I tried getting into Obj-C several times but never really got into it. With Swift it was fun and I was able to make a small app relativiley quickly.
21:23 hydrajump  s/relativiley/relatively
21:35 semiosis   obj-c is horrible
21:35 semiosis   thanks for reassuring me.  i'd like to try some ios/mac development but obj-c was always a blocker
21:45 hydrajump  semiosis: i just do it on and off, but definitely enjoy it more than obj-c ;)
21:45 hydrajump  semiosis: you want to use it for work or side-projects?
21:52 semiosis   work mainly
21:53 semiosis   we have an ios app that is kind of a mess.  i'd like to rewrite it.
21:56 pdurbin    semiosis: you gonna work on an android app too?
21:57 semiosis   we also have an android app, yes, and it's in line for a refresh
21:58 semiosis   i've worked on both of them, and while the android app is better, they are both showing their age and need to be updated with newer frameworks, etc
22:11 semiosis   would be great to have a cross platform app but i dont think that's possible yet
22:12 prologic   kivy comes to mind
22:12 prologic   or phonegap
22:12 prologic   these let you build cross-platform mobile apps
22:13 semiosis   but... python
22:13 prologic   but what?
22:13 prologic   fyi I'm a Pythonista :)
22:13 semiosis   i've tried but i just can't get excited about writing python
22:15 prologic   oh well
22:15 pdurbin    BURN HIM!
22:15 prologic   *meh*
22:15 prologic   I'm tired :)
22:15 prologic   I cbf convincing a person to use a nice language :)
22:15 pdurbin    s/BURN HIM/oh well/
22:15 * prologic sips his coffee
22:16 semiosis   i think we can all agree on coffee
22:16 prologic   :)
22:16 prologic   there are lots of languages, tools and frameworks
22:16 prologic   they're all as good and as bad as each other really
22:16 prologic   so do whatever :)
22:16 semiosis   ok
22:17 prologic   heh
22:24 semiosis   sales guy asks if we can say our software is "In the cloud" ;(
22:26 prologic   did you say "fuck no"? :)
22:26 prologic   or wait
22:26 prologic   "look outside mate?"
22:26 prologic   "do you see those white things?"
22:27 semiosis   haha
22:27 prologic   "our software isn't in those things!"
22:27 prologic   silly bsstards
22:27 prologic   why can't we just damn well call it for what it is
22:27 prologic   "Our software runs on xyz servers located in abc DC"
22:27 prologic   blah
22:56 pdurbin    the cloud is any server room I haven't stepped foot in
23:02 prologic   haha
23:02 prologic   that's a clever way of putting it :)
23:03 prologic   I suppose if Docker get theri way we'll be calling things "Oceans"
23:03 prologic   :)
23:03 prologic   "Our xyz software is in the ocean!"
23:04 pdurbin    I forget where I heard that.
23:04 pdurbin    the cloud sounds better. they dump stuff in the ocean
23:09 semiosis   clouds dump stuff in the ocean
23:12 prologic   lol
23:13 prologic   This could be a new trend guys
23:13 prologic   we could be the ones to coin the new term :)
23:24 semiosis   don't let your cloud provider dump you in the digital ocean!
23:24 semiosis   our servers aren't just in the clouds, but completely above & beyond them!!!
23:27 prologic   havens?
23:33 hydrajump  silly question but when you run `ls -l` what does the number after the permissions mean, e.g. `drwxrwxr-x 3`? I googled and it said "number of links", but the directory doesn't have any links as far as I can tell
23:37 semiosis   hydrajump: looks like number of subdirs, incl . & ..
23:38 semiosis   oh, inode links, that makes sense
23:38 semiosis   i think
23:38 hydrajump  yeah looks right :P
23:41 pdurbin    hard links
23:42 pdurbin    https://www.gnu.org/software/coreutils/manual/html_node/What-information-is-listed.html
23:43 pdurbin    this is where http://explainshell.com/explain?cmd=ls+-l falls down. this stuff is in "info" docs
23:50 hydrajump  thanks pdurbin
