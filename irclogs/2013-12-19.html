03:36 pdurbin     RSA Key Extraction via Low-Bandwidth Acoustic Cryptanalysis: http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tromer/acoustic/
03:37 pdurbin     "The attack can extract full 4096-bit RSA decryption keys from laptop computers (of various models), within an hour, using the sound generated by the computer during the decryption of some chosen ciphertexts."
15:44 whorka      that's like TEMPEST level snooping
15:49 jgtimmer    sounds like van eyck freaking to me
15:50 jgtimmer    Van Eck phreaking*
15:50 sagotsky    :-D
15:53 whorka      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Eck_phreaking#See_also
15:54 whorka      first time I learned of this kind of snopping was back in the days when modems had RX/TX LEDs on the front
15:54 whorka      apparently you could reconstruct bytes from careful measurement of their timing
15:55 whorka      *snooping :P
15:56 whorka      it's like shoulder-surfing writ large
18:57 pdurbin     TEMPEST?
19:27 whorka      follow the link ^^
19:35 pdurbin     oh. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TEMPEST . thanks
20:57 * JoeJulian grumbles at Rackspace...
21:06 JoeJulian   Turns out that with the "next gen" service, you cannot retrieve your own images. Guess I'll be shopping for a new provider. :(
22:57 pdurbin     next gen?
