22:49 joshu   anyone used owncloud?
22:51 pdurbin joshu: not yet. you?
22:51 joshu   pdurbin heyâ€¦no same here. considering setting up an instance on AWS but just been reading about it for now
22:52 pdurbin joshu: I talked to the owncloud guy at northeastlinuxfest. seems like a nice project
22:54 joshu   pdurbin the main reason I'm looking at using it is due to Apple's removal of sync services in Mavericks and the push to using iCloud for contacts and calendar syncing, which I'm against. Only other option is to setup your own caldav, carddav server to enable syncing, both of which owncloud offers.
22:58 pdurbin Apple seems so... closed and controlling
