13:00 pdurbin dotplus: "challenged" let's say :)
13:00 pdurbin anyway
13:00 pdurbin what do people think of this? https://github.com/mozillascience/site/commit/0456491dbd8627757f85ecf1076f6fb534bdab68#commitcomment-9748672
13:03 pdurbin is anyone here an "owner" of an organization on GitHub?
14:43 dotplus pdurbin: yes
15:37 pdurbin dotplus: and is your organization mentioned when you go to http://www.mozillascience.org/auth/github ?
15:37 pdurbin and if you hover over the green checkmark does it say "This organization allows the application to access private organization data and modify public organization data."?
16:10 pdurbin confirmation that others see the same thing: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2015-02-14
20:17 pdurbin and yet, the login via github at http://forum.mozillascience.org is not scary
20:25 bene    i think you should open an issue
20:26 bene    commit comments are not a forum for conversation i think
21:40 pdurbin yeah
21:40 pdurbin bene: so do you think it's an odd default too? on the github side?
22:07 bene    no idea
22:19 pdurbin bene: lemme know your github username if you have time for a quick experiment
