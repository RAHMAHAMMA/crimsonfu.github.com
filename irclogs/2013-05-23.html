00:59 melodie      pdurbin here is a discussion I just had at #linuxchix, about scrot and import:
00:59 melodie      I think you would be interested about the point of view
00:59 melodie      <melodie> what is wrong with import ?
00:59 melodie      <melodie> zoe very nice!
00:59 melodie      <akk> import doesn't work with all window managers, often gives big black areas instead of the window contents, etc.
00:59 melodie      <akk> depending on what args you use
00:59 melodie      <akk> and imagemagick is always fiddling with their args, so args that work now won't necessarily work after the next upgrade.
00:59 melodie      <melodie> thanks akk I will report it to the person who told me about import
00:59 melodie      <melodie> if you don't mind of course
00:59 melodie      <akk> Feel free.
00:59 melodie      <melodie> thanks!

01:01 pdurbin      I'm reading more of the anti-database argument at http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-22#t1369253767 but I'm still not convinced
01:01 pdurbin      and it's making me tired :)
01:32 melodie      pdurbin don't read it anymore then
01:33 melodie      :)
01:33 melodie      good night
14:22 JoeJulian    Now that I've read the documentation for USB HID1.11 keyboards, I've come to the conclusion that Alan Stern is a proctological orifice.

14:27 JoeJulian    I asked a fairly simple question in the linux-usb mailing list to clarify my understanding of a usbmon capture. Since what I was capturing was the output from a credit card reader I, for obvious reasons, couldn't just post the capture. Rather than telling me that I was right, and expanding on my understanding, he chastised me for not posting sufficient data, "... how should I know?  You haven't posted any detailed information ..." After readi
14:27 JoeJulian    ng the spec, yes. He should have known.
14:35 pdurbin      we are none of us perfect
17:09 codex        https://github.com/ventz/pgsvr -> puppet git sync via rest (rest app for r10k) -- if anyone is interested
17:14 pdurbin      codex: as opposed to ssh or the git protocol?
17:20 codex        as in to signal via REST
17:20 codex        so that you can have a github hook that simply signals r10k to do a pull
17:21 pdurbin      ok. sorry I'm in JPA EclipseLink hell right now... if anyone has any ideas for me: https://redmine.hmdc.harvard.edu/issues/2976
21:15 pdurbin      fixed. thank goodness :)
