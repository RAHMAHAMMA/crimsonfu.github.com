05:51 Azgarech Hello all
08:07 Azgarech Hi all
08:08 Azgarech I am going to setup a linux bridged machine to do analysis of the traffic generated by my users in preparation of a network separation
08:08 Azgarech do you know any tools to do so before I gonna look around and/or create Iptables specific script?
09:36 prologic Don't you want to port mirror instead?
09:36 prologic and perform offline analysis of the traffic
09:43 Azgarech For now I thinked to put a machine in bridge mod with ntop and Iptables in Logging
09:47 prologic in order for that to work hwoever
09:47 prologic your machine would have to route the traffic
09:48 prologic which makes modifying your network slightly
09:48 prologic I'd just mirror the port traffic
09:52 Azgarech for now I don't get any troubles in my virtual creation
10:49 prologic oh this is virtual
10:49 prologic okay :)
22:28 melodie  good night
