13:44 tfhartmann Hey Crimsonfu... what do people here think of Slack?
13:48 pdurbin    tfhartmann: I've heard good things but I run an IRC logger (thought not in this channel) so I can own the data. I'm not sure what the "data liberation" story is for Slack.
13:48 tfhartmann I just threw up an account, so far it's got a very irc feel
13:49 tfhartmann if you want to kick it around I'll send ya an invite to my "company"
13:54 pdurbin    tfhartmann: I'd be interested in trying Slack some day.
13:57 tfhartmann invite sent. Slack is free so you could have totally set up your own company/team or whatever, but I figured it might be more interesting to have another person to talk to :p
14:09 pdurbin    thanks. will check it out at some point. trying to get this profiler working
14:09 pdurbin    free but limited log history, last time I looked
14:12 tfhartmann good to know!
22:21 pdurbin    prologic: here's another new Linux for ya: https://github.com/papyros/mockups
23:08 prologic   haha
23:10 prologic   http://papyros.io/faq/index.html\\
23:10 prologic   http://papyros.io/faq/index.html
23:10 prologic   ValLInux is positively better in everyway :)
23:10 prologic   haha
23:10 prologic   but maybe we can package their Desktop Shell when it becomes mature :)
23:10 prologic   lol
23:10 prologic   "Built on top of Arch"
23:10 prologic   pffft
23:11 prologic   I'd hardly call that a new Linux
23:11 prologic   but a fork/derivative of Arch :)
23:16 pdurbin    that's harsh but true
23:17 prologic   lol
23:17 prologic   don't get me wrong
23:17 prologic   they may in fact build a really kick ass desktop shell
23:17 prologic   I might even like it assuming the whole Wayland thing give me full screne zoom like compiz fusion's ezoom
23:18 prologic   so we'll see :)
23:55 pdurbin    does Wayland work yet?
