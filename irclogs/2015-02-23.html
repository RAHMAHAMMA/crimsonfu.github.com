15:17 pdurbin    bear: thanks for the retweet! :)
15:17 bear       :)
15:46 pdurbin    someone walked by and suggested adding this to the blog post http://i669.photobucket.com/albums/vv57/gudsrost/My%20GIFs/Ren-and-Stimpy-red-button-anim2.gif :)
17:49 dotplus    pdurbin: re: jekyll. If you're looking at a new static site generator, I would encourage you to look at http://gohugo.io
18:41 pdurbin    dotplus: thanks. I was just wanting to post that blog post on GitHub Pages, which uses Jekyll.

21:16 pdurbin    semiosis: heh
21:16 pdurbin    oh cool, some feedback from a githubber on my post: https://github.com/mozillascience/site/issues/11#issuecomment-75589627
21:18 semiosis   nice
21:20 pdurbin    "if an org member has read-only access, the app will not have write access to that org's repo for the user"
21:20 pdurbin    hmm
21:20 pdurbin    I still find the screen confusing and scary. Where I'm prompted to authorize an app.
21:22 skay       hi, do any of you have experience getting xdummy working in a docker container? friend of friend who is working on an academic project in reproducible research in robots is having troubles
21:22 skay       oh hi marcoceppi, I think I recognize you from juju
21:23 pdurbin    skay: careful. you might wake up marcoceppi. he doesn't talk much ;)
21:24 pdurbin    skay: codex and prologic and hydrajump know a thing or two about docker
21:25 skay       pdurbin: I could forward the email to you, and you could perhaps share it with friends who might be able to help
21:25 * pdurbin  hates email
21:26 skay       bwahaha ok
21:26 codex      skay: some more info -- what's the trouble?
21:26 skay       I hate phone calls more
21:26 pdurbin    skay: can you pastebin it?
21:26 skay       sure
21:27 codex      also, have you tried existing: https://github.com/bencawkwell/dockerfile-xpra
21:27 skay       sorry for the horrible formatting http://paste.ubuntu.com/10377940/
21:29 codex      skay: I pasted the commands for your dockerfile that you need, here:
21:29 codex      http://pastebin.com/9MmtHv5D
21:29 skay       codex: I have not. I don't know if Jon has, I'll pass it along to him
21:29 codex      sub "saucy" with another version --> all this assumes running Ubuntu
21:35 skay       thanks codex, I'm passing along the information to him.
21:35 skay       and also pointed him to #sciencelab on mozilla's irc servers along with their discussion group. might help him later when he has more questions
21:36 skay       some of the folks who are loosely connected there do work in reproducible research and containers and/or vms
21:36 prologic   lol a thing or two :)
21:36 prologic   hmm
21:36 * skay     mostly uses lxc along with juju
21:37 codex      docker is mostly just lxc :)
21:37 codex      "sort of kind of, not anymore"
21:37 prologic   ihmo docker is a better user expeirence and ecosystem :)
21:37 codex      with a really nice config engine on top and a ton of methodologies
21:37 prologic   it is what lxc is
21:37 prologic   but not lxc
21:38 prologic   it interfaces with the same kernel calls
21:38 prologic   yeah :)
21:38 codex      I think docker officially split off of LXC 100%, but yea, same calls underneath
21:38 prologic   like I said very nice ecosystem
21:38 prologic   they split off from using lxc lib back in 0.7.x something
21:38 codex      what I can't understand is why openvz never became this popular
21:38 prologic   which made sense anyway
21:38 prologic   code to the kernel
21:38 prologic   not even drive
21:38 codex      it seems to be the best of both worlds -- light like containers, but still full VMs
21:38 prologic   and not the right time I think
21:39 prologic   it's all about timing and marketing sometimes
21:39 prologic   have the right idea at the right time
21:39 codex      that's true
21:39 prologic   that's how some make millions
21:39 marcoceppi pdurbin: skay  o/
21:39 prologic   whilst others like us just make a living
21:39 skay       o/
21:39 prologic   anyway work time
21:40 prologic   skay if you need to know anything in detail about Docker from a usage pov hit me up
21:40 skay       prologic: sure thing
21:40 skay       if you are in the midwest consider talking to #chicagolug about it. I am looking to see if someone from marcoceppi's team would like to give us a talk and it would be on topic in that case
21:41 skay       hi marcoceppi! I've been learning the juju ecosystem and thought it would be interested to talk to my group about it and then figured, why not ask you guys
21:41 skay       I've been emailing back and forth
21:42 marcoceppi skay: sounds cool
21:42 marcoceppi We dont really have anyone in the Chicago area though
21:43 skay       marcoceppi: yeah, a couple of you said they might ride the train in
21:43 marcoceppi I'm on an airplane ATM, I'll ping you in a bit
21:43 skay       k, later
21:44 prologic   unfortunately I'm from the AU
21:44 prologic   :)
21:44 skay       :)
