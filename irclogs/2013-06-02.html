16:25 melodie   hi
16:52 pdurbin   melodie: hi. what's new?
16:53 melodie   hi pdurbin
16:53 melodie   let me think
16:53 melodie   this is new (title : "guess where you appeared") Devinez où vous êtes apparu - http://linuxvillage.net/index.php/topic,372.0.html
16:54 melodie   just click to the link in the post, you will have a fun game to do: guess where on Earth you are? :)
16:54 pdurbin   the link is for http://geoguessr.com
16:55 melodie   yes
16:55 melodie   you knew it? :D
16:55 pdurbin   nope. new to me
16:56 pdurbin   heh. I got 1790 points for a completely random guess :)
16:56 pdurbin   seems fun. thanks
16:57 pdurbin   melodie: do you remember how were were talking once about having member pages where you write down your time zone?
16:58 melodie   I remember you talked about it
16:58 pdurbin   I recently added "pdurbin (-0500/-0400)" to http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC_People
16:58 melodie   I am not much into that kind of thing though
16:58 pdurbin   "A list of IRC regulars, sorted by nick, and their normal timezones (winter/summer)."
16:58 melodie   you told me about it
16:59 melodie   pdurbin what use do you see for it?
16:59 pdurbin   well, at http://indiewebcamp.com/IRC_People there are a variety of time zones
16:59 pdurbin   it seems helpful
17:02 pdurbin   anyway, the main reason I added myself to that wiki was that I was curious about the authentication system they use. rather than a traditional username/password you sign in with your domain (for me http://greptilian.com ) using a system called IndieAuth
17:02 pdurbin   IndieAuth - Sign in with your domain name - https://indieauth.com
17:03 pdurbin   this is my write up about IndieAuth: https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/XHAQqzRQW9k
17:03 pdurbin   it's somewhat like OpenID
17:03 pdurbin   which I never bothered to set up
17:04 pdurbin   IndieAuth is easier, in my opinion. it sends the auth request to another site such as GitHub or Google
17:08 melodie   ok
17:08 pdurbin   :)
17:09 pdurbin   shuff would appreciate this. where the hell is shuff?
17:09 pdurbin   speaking of member pages, at least he has one: http://crimsonfu.github.io/members/shuff
17:10 melodie   on this kind of page: http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2013-05-30#t1369963742 the fonts are too thin for my sight, and zoomin in does not help, it makes them bigger but not ticker
17:11 melodie   he has a gpg key. Do you do gpg key signing parties sometimes?
17:13 melodie   pdurbin reading here now: https://indieauth.com
17:13 * pdurbin tweets at shuff: https://twitter.com/philipdurbin/status/341240932613623808
17:13 melodie   " We should not be relying on Twitter or Facebook to provide our authenticated identities, we should be able to use our own domain names to log in to sites everywhere."
17:13 melodie   is it false to think that O-Auth does the same thing?
17:14 pdurbin   probably indieauth uses oauth
17:14 pdurbin   I haven't gotten around to setting up GPG keys for myself. some day. I played with encrypted email a decade ago but that's about it
17:15 pdurbin   I guess we used to sign our RPMs with GPG keys too
17:15 pdurbin   but I've never had a personal one
17:23 melodie   ok
17:23 melodie   I wonder if people in US care less than in Europe about privacy or if it's only a range of people?
17:24 pdurbin   Germany seems to greatly value privacy
17:32 melodie   which clues do you have related to that?
17:32 melodie   (phone)
17:37 pdurbin   Jeff Jarvis says this all the time on This Week in Google
17:38 pdurbin   he calls it Blurmany because some Germans what Google to blur their pictures on Street View (part of Google Maps)
18:30 pdurbin_m want*
18:41 pdurbin_m melodie: I got some chatter going at http://irclogs.ubuntu.com/2013/06/02/%23ubuntu-women-project.html
18:42 pdurbin_m about a post by a female sysadmin about women in tech

18:43 melodie   bbl
23:18 melodie   is there anyone in the present chan who happens to live in California?
23:19 melodie   I have a new Google Earth running in my tower, (64bits Archlinux install) and I visited some parts with it, it looks quite nice!
23:19 melodie   I wonder if it was more hot there than in France last 10 days, here we have been almost freezing! ^^
23:19 melodie   pdurbin I have looked at your links. :)
23:26 pdurbin   it's been hot in Boston. and our furnace kicked on because the thermostat is in my neighbor's unit and they had their A/C way up :(
23:27 melodie   does this mean your appartment was getting very hot because your neighbor used all the cooling for himself?
23:29 melodie   pdurbin in fact I am looking for someone who could talk to me about the way the current life goes in California, San Francisco
23:29 melodie   I try to find clues on the web atm
23:30 melodie   thinking of heat, in France we are not many yet using air conditioning. I have learned a tip to cool the air without and air conditionning. would you like me to tell you about it?
23:30 pdurbin   it does mean my apartment was getting even hotter until I went to the furnace itself and shut it off manually. then we went to a park and cooled off in a fountain until the radiators cooled off
23:31 melodie   ok I get it now
23:31 melodie   what does "A/C" stand for?
23:31 pdurbin   very frustrating
23:31 melodie   sure. :-(
23:31 pdurbin   A/C is for air conditioning
23:31 melodie   oh yes ! XD
23:31 melodie   ok. :)
23:32 melodie   so about the tip? Interested?
23:33 pdurbin   oh sure
23:35 melodie   it could be useful, if you need to get the A/C lower, or if it is exceptionnally broken when the season is hot.
23:36 melodie   you will fill a basin with water, and use a fan which will blow above the surface of the water
23:37 melodie   I had done that in a house where I was living. All shutter closed and this setup allowed to have about 26° C whereas outside it was almost 40° C
23:38 melodie   it raises the level of humidity and brings a feeling of freshness
23:38 pdurbin   I've hear this tip before but I've never tried it
23:38 melodie   I have, I must say it helps
23:39 pdurbin   cool
23:39 pdurbin   ;)
23:39 melodie   of course when the weather was so hot I would open the windows only starting from 3 am to about 6 am :D
23:39 melodie   therefore keeping the fresh air inside as long as possible
23:40 melodie   I have been in the US when I was 16 and I was amazed about the A/C, at that time no one I know of had such a system in France. In the middle of summer I almost caught a cold. XD
23:46 pdurbin   we try not to use it too much
23:50 melodie   :)
23:50 melodie   I have it in my car and I really could not go without it anymore.
23:51 melodie   there are times during summer if I don't lower at least 5°C less it's just impossible for me to drive safely
