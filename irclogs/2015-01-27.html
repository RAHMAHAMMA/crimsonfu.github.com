00:03 prologic     project2501a hate to tell you this but no-one can view that link since cookies are required
00:03 project2501a Other than that, I am a total geek: I am coding up a batch scheduler (C), I enjoy a good game of CaH and Munchkin, I practice Shotokan karate (and have trained with JKA Boston and Toryu-sensei)
00:03 project2501a aw :(
00:03 prologic     so you've copied/pasted something that will only work for your curent session :)
00:03 project2501a damn. that's Harvard's own HR system
00:04 prologic     Web sucks :)
00:04 prologic     get over it :)
00:04 project2501a let's go back to Usenet
00:04 project2501a or gopher
00:04 project2501a let me screencap the pages
00:06 project2501a https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGWEbHost/jobdetails.aspx?partnerID=25240&siteID=5341&AReq=34213BR
00:06 project2501a how is that?
00:06 bene         you can just link the auto req id and those are findable
00:06 prologic     I love Gopher :)
00:06 prologic     gopher://daisy.shortcircuit.net.au/
00:06 prologic     big (new) fan of it :)
00:06 bene         and you did find the magic url
00:06 bene         did they fix the security holes in the gopherds?
00:06 project2501a Auto req ID	34213BR
00:07 prologic     bane: which gopherd?
00:07 bene         i looked at the packages that were still around a few years back and they all had "do not run on the public internet!"
00:07 prologic     there are many now
00:07 prologic     I even wrote one recently
00:07 bene         interesting
00:07 bene         i had no idea there was a resurgence in popularity
00:07 prologic     https://bitbucket.org/prologic/cgod
00:07 prologic     seems to be a slight resurgence yeah
00:07 prologic     even by new folks who've never heard of GOpher before
00:08 project2501a does the second brassring URL open for everyone?
00:10 prologic     yeah
00:10 prologic     but I can't help you :)
00:10 project2501a Thank you, anyway!
00:10 project2501a at least, I am not in my own little private session of the web
00:11 project2501a Resume at: https://www.dropbox.com/s/i1pp3a67ukgnptz/george_marselis_2014-08-19.pdf
00:16 project2501a Thank you!
00:36 pdurbin      project2501a: welcome! I'm catching up on the logs. sounds like these tinyurls don't work?
00:39 pdurbin      here's a working link: https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGWEbHost/jobdetails.aspx?partnerID=25240&siteID=5341&AReq=34213BR
00:40 pdurbin      that one's at https://rc.fas.harvard.edu where I used to work
00:40 pdurbin      project2501a: I guess that was your "1."  Scientific Systems Administrator
00:45 pdurbin      project2501a: if you give us the other Auto req ID's we can tell you if we know the other groups too.
00:47 project2501a ok!
00:49 project2501a pdurbin:  one sec, I need to log back into the HR system
00:49 pdurbin      no hurry, this channel is logged
00:52 project2501a pduring: 2. Systems Administrator 34157BR
00:53 project2501a 3. Site Reliability Engineer 33968BR
00:53 project2501a oops, missed one: Senior DevOps Engineer - Tech Lead 34454BR
00:54 project2501a pdurbin:  but seriously, the RC job is my best choice, since it is what I was doing in KAUST. I would love to continue working along with scientists.
00:55 pdurbin      oh so https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGWEbHost/jobdetails.aspx?partnerID=25240&siteID=5341&AReq=34157BR is at http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/cbar/ ... I don't know much about HSPH but I know people who work there.
00:56 project2501a that's choice no 2. Bioinformatics
00:57 pdurbin      https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGWEbHost/jobdetails.aspx?partnerID=25240&siteID=5341&AReq=33968BR is for http://cbs.fas.harvard.edu ... Center for Brain Science
00:57 project2501a is the HPSH in Boston?
00:57 pdurbin      yeah
00:57 pdurbin      I think!
00:58 pdurbin      yeah. LMA. Longwood Medical Area. Boston
00:58 project2501a Meh, it's all good. I have visited Boston three times and I love the place. one with LISA and two visiting my best friend there
00:58 pdurbin      https://sjobs.brassring.com/TGWEbHost/jobdetails.aspx?partnerID=25240&siteID=5341&AReq=34454BR is at http://hms.harvard.edu ... also Boston
00:59 project2501a υθπ
01:00 project2501a erh, i mean "yup"
01:00 pdurbin      RC is a great place to connect with scientists: https://rc.fas.harvard.edu/news-home/feature-stories/
01:00 project2501a Wow. Really nice organised website.
01:01 pdurbin      it's fairly new
01:03 project2501a pdurbin:  https://plus.google.com/104128007317621911349/photos/photo/5843410399597379570?pid=5843410399597379570&oid=104128007317621911349
01:03 project2501a that's the first cluster I made for the bioinformatics center
01:03 project2501a not pictured: 3com switch
01:04 project2501a It was during the first 6 months where KAUST started, back in 2009
01:04 project2501a we kinda had to McGuiver it
01:05 project2501a back in 2009, procuring computers in Saudi Arabia was ... an adventure
01:08 pdurbin      heh. those towers have plenty of space!
01:08 project2501a I switched later on to HP DL machines and juniper switches.
01:08 project2501a those were dual 6-core xeons with 24GB ram
01:09 pdurbin      cool, cool
01:09 pdurbin      whelp, I gotta read a story to my kid before bed
01:09 project2501a initial benchmarking had that small cluster at 177teraflops
01:09 project2501a it lasted 3 years.
01:10 project2501a pdurbin:  no worries. i'll be here if you can manage after that
01:21 bene         the sr devops position at hms is with the research computing group: https://rc.hms.harvard.edu/
01:22 project2501a bene: Hi! OK, thank you!
01:22 bene         BD Kim is the group leader and Christ Botka is the director
01:22 bene         Chris
01:22 bene         i worked at hms for 7 years, so i know all those peeps
01:22 bene         i have no idea about the non-US worker bit
01:22 project2501a heh, yeah, that's the tough part.
01:23 bene         i do know that it's generally easier to get in if you have a phd
01:23 project2501a E-1 specialized worker
01:23 bene         masters doesn't give them as much wiggle room
01:23 project2501a HPC system administrators count as much.
01:23 bene         with a phd, they can give you a "research position" initially and then transfer you to staff if you like them/they like you
01:23 project2501a same as PhDs.
01:24 project2501a ooh. ok, I see.
01:24 bene         yeah, they can get you in the back door that way
01:24 bene         probably not really legal, but i have seen it done before :-)
01:25 project2501a hehehe
01:25 project2501a I had an interview with Rutgers last fall. They suggested the New Jersey Espressway way
01:25 project2501a #friendofours
01:26 project2501a bene:  is there a chance I can get in touch with any of those gentlemen?
01:26 project2501a or get an introduction or something?
01:26 project2501a I mean, it would be kinda awkward to message the gentlemen out of the blue.
01:30 project2501a and of course, if you are comfortable with it. I just want to pass my resume along.
01:30 bene         i can cc you into an email with chris
01:30 bene         but i'm not sure what it will buy you
01:31 bene         it's probably as effective to submit through the HR portal and then email him directly saying you researched the position, talked to some other harvard employees and felt like you owuld be a good fit, etc
01:31 project2501a Ah! OK, that works
01:31 bene         standard cover letter, but showing that you made some effort to learn more about hte position
01:31 bene         you can mention you talked to me
01:31 project2501a the job has been open for 68 days so far.
01:31 bene         i think he has a good opinion of me :-)
01:31 bene         yeah
01:31 project2501a so, no good candidates.
01:31 bene         so the downside to that position is that hms has a hard time keeping people
01:31 bene         nods
01:31 project2501a how come?
01:35 bene         pdurbin can probably give you some details on the fasrc job
01:37 bene         james cuff is the director of that group
01:37 bene         he's active on twitter
01:37 bene         you can DM him and he'll probably respond
01:37 project2501a ok!
01:38 bene         http://blog.jcuff.net/
01:38 bene         i have to put some boys to bed
01:38 bene         i'll be back in an hour
01:38 project2501a alright!
01:39 project2501a re: xservers: I am trying to bring a gpl'ed version of Platform LSF to MacOSX Yoshemite
01:45 pdurbin      project2501a: you could also lurk at http://groups.google.com/group/odybot
01:46 project2501a ok!
02:00 project2501a http://blog.jcuff.net/2014/12/of-big-microscopes-and-even-bigger-data.html holy crap it reminds me of the filesystem on Lumina Next Gen machines
02:17 pdurbin      James, if you're reading this, you're welcome back any time! http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-03-02#i_5237486 :)

21:46 pdurbin      codex: patched. thanks
22:37 pdurbin      of course, based on https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0090.html only RHEL5 is affected, not RHEL6
22:40 pdurbin      oh, this is for RHEL6 and RHEL7: https://rhn.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2015-0092.html
22:51 project2501a char cseqno;
22:51 project2501a int seqno;
22:51 project2501a cseqno = seqno;
22:51 project2501a shoot me.
22:52 project2501a *cough* i meant, what wonderful coders scientists are.
