01:54 semiosis pdurbin: been reflecting a bit lately, since it's been almost a year since i switched from eclipse to idea, and I realized it was 100% the right choice.
01:55 semiosis i know you like open source software -- i do too -- but if you're doing java professionally you should seriously consider investing in an idea ultimate license
01:55 semiosis or better yet have your employer get you one
