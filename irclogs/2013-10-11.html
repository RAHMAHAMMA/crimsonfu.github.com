13:14 dotplus   grr, "read the source" does not count as documentation, especially not for an established, complex network service daemon. if you have a significant number of stub entries in your public docs, it's not even a 1.x release.
13:17 pdurbin   it happens
13:17 dotplus   oh and yes, I get the "patches welcome" thing. I have already offered corrections where I know the answers. If you don't have a reasonably simple "how to contribute" process, *especially* for docs, you're shooting yourself in the foot
13:18 pdurbin   dotplus: what's your favorite "how to contribute" example?
13:19 dotplus   that's a tough one. I don't have a good one off the top of my head.
13:20 dotplus   and there isn't a one size fits all for this
13:22 pdurbin   I think https://www.thinkup.com/docs/contribute/index.html is pretty good
13:25 dotplus   didn't have to dig very far to find a glaring hole: https://www.thinkup.com/docs/contribute/developers/writecode/bugfix.html
13:27 pdurbin   hmm, I wonder if that is supposed to be a link to https://www.thinkup.com/docs/contribute/developers/tests.html#writing-tests
13:27 dotplus   however, in general the list of bullets on https://www.thinkup.com/docs/contribute/developers/index.html looks like a pretty good starting point for someone designing a "how to contribute" process/doc
13:29 dotplus   perhaps, I just went "contribute>developer>write code>fix a bug", which seems like the obvious trail for someone who has found a simple problem (and possibly has a solution). maybe I should offer a docs patch:)
13:31 pdurbin   sure. for now I dropped a link at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/thinkup/2013-10-11
13:40 * dotplus boggles at the sight of that butterfly.
13:40 dotplus   is someone _using_ perl6?
14:07 pdurbin   of course! http://irclog.perlgeek.de/perl6/2013-10-11
