00:28 hydrajump I got it after lots of trial and error. apparently you need to disable amzn-main and amzn-updates repos
01:59 pdurbin   could also use rpm rather than yum. rpm -Uvh path/to/my.rpm
21:58 larsks    hydrajump: possibly "yum localinstall", maybe also with "--disablerepo=*".
22:18 pdurbin   oh yeah. that too
