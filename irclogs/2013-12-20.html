15:09 fak3r        hey pdurbin I'm back on irccloud and still had this bookmarked
15:09 pdurbin      +1
15:10 fak3r        thanks for sharing tmate.io, hadn't heard of that, on a more 'consumer' level, we've used https://join.me/ for similar colab
15:11 pdurbin      cool. the thing I like is "Host your own tmate server"
15:13 fak3r        definitely. yesterday I installed the latest owncloud - hadn't tried it in a few years, and it's getting really good
15:13 pdurbin      nice
15:13 fak3r        have the OSX client, and file sync'ing works just like dropbox/spideroak, but of course on your own server
15:13 pdurbin      fak3r: what was your thing?
15:15 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky fak3r dropbox alternative

15:16 pdurbin      hmm. http://lipsync.info I guess
15:16 fak3r        ha, that's it - have been meaning to revisit and try to code it in python
15:17 pdurbin      fak3r: I thought you had one in bash
15:20 fak3r        yep, that's it, it is still bash as I slowly plot on reworking it
15:20 pdurbin      gotcha
