11:46 pdurbin    just a reminder for Boston locals that I'm going to the NorthEast Linux Fest (NELF) today if anyone would like to join me: http://irclog.greptilian.com/northeastlinuxfest/2014-04-05
12:43 westmaas   JoeJulian: yeah, ticket is the best way - but if I could get more info that'd help too - are they always using the same image? is it a base image? custom? etc
16:01 pdurbin_m2 heh. just got interviewed by http://hackerpublicradio.org
16:02 pdurbin_m2 larsks: mattdm is here. introduced me to some folks at the red hat table
16:35 dotplus    pdurbin_m2: re hsqldb. PuppetDB is where I came across it, although they recommend postgresql instead if your environment is > ~100 nodes
16:39 larsks     pdurbin_m2: Say hello to mattdm!  There are too many birthday's happening in our house this weekend for me to attend.
16:41 larsks     s/'//
16:42 pdurbin_m2 huh. XFS will be the default in RHEL 7
16:43 pdurbin_m2 dotplus: puppetdb is written in clojure, which is neat
16:45 pdurbin_m2 larsks: sounds like you two are in pretty different groups
16:51 pdurbin_m2 dotplus: makes sense... on the JVM already
