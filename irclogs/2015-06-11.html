12:15 pdurbin bene: good paper. and it's pretty interesting what they've built: "We're re-imagining mailing lists and community discourse for the age of social media" http://murmur.csail.mit.edu
14:07 bene    okay, i read amy's presentation on mailing lists
14:08 bene    are you talking about the ACM paper? or the presentation?
14:09 bene    the paper seems to be mostly expansion on the presentation
14:14 bene    i am not convinced
14:39 pdurbin I read the paper.
