02:02 pdurbin   finally, some real data science
02:41 hydrajump anyone going to be in San Francisco in June?
02:41 hydrajump and wants to meetup
16:07 hydrajump wow didn't expect this https://github.com/blog/1831-atom-free-and-open-source-for-everyone
16:07 hydrajump http://blog.atom.io/2014/05/06/atom-is-now-open-source.html
16:09 semiosis  i'm more excited about this Atom Shell thing than the atom editor.  https://github.com/atom/atom-shell
16:09 semiosis  glad to see they did the right thing tho
16:11 semiosis  lmao at the windows requirements for atom editor
16:11 semiosis  lmao at all things windows generally though
16:15 hydrajump hehe yeah I've been interested in how they built a native app using node.js in the background. I wonder if atom-shell can be easily used to create other apps
16:16 semiosis  that seems to be the idea
16:20 hydrajump semiosis: https://github.com/atom/atom-shell/blob/master/docs/tutorial/quick-start.md
16:20 hydrajump very cool
16:20 hydrajump I'm still learning node.js, but this could come in handy
16:47 pdurbin   semiosis: are you gonna stop complaining that github doesn't open source enough stuff?
16:48 hydrajump haha
16:48 semiosis  then what motivation would they have to open source things?
16:49 hydrajump There a dockerconf 2014 that I just found out about http://www.dockercon.com/
16:50 semiosis  how long do you think until RH buys docker?
16:51 semiosis  wow $599?!?! thats a lot!
16:51 hydrajump yeah that's why i won't be going :(
20:39 hydrajump CSS is tricky
