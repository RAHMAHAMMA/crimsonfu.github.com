13:42 dotplus westmaas: a coworker recently went to some openstack training. He had ~no exposure to it previously, but basically understands IaaS as a concept. His summary was "definitely technology we should be experimenting with and I think we can find some good use cases here for it.  I am a bit surprised at how widely [known|used|hyped] it is as it doesn't quite have the feel to me of production-ready software."
13:42 dotplus Care to comment?
