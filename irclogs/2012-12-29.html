01:57 rackerhacker pdurbin_m: i figured out how to get decent markdown data out of WP with jekyll's tools -- now i just need to get a decent web design going before i can use pelican full time
02:28 pdurbin      ironcamel: nice
02:28 pdurbin      JoeJulian: buh. i'll let you know
02:30 pdurbin      rackerhacker: i just commented on a post about pelican. apparently, it's all the rage. https://plus.google.com/114723964985237592593/posts/N8jnK4a34G7
02:32 pdurbin      rackerhacker: i get a lot of mileage out of this: my $wc = new HTML::WikiConverter( dialect =&gt; 'Markdown' );
02:32 pdurbin      http://search.cpan.org/dist/HTML-WikiConverter/
03:10 rackerhacker ah, i tossed in my $0.02
03:11 rackerhacker my requirement for it was that the static generator was written in python
03:11 rackerhacker so it came down to nikola, mynt or pelican
03:11 rackerhacker pelican seemed to be the most straightforward
15:01 jimi_c       my $0.02: i've gotten a lot of use out of jekyll, having to use it for our github project page
15:02 jimi_c       and twitter bootstrap = nice and easy + good looking web page
15:02 semiosis     surprised i've not heard anyone mention octopress... my impression was that it succeeded jekyll
15:06 jimi_c       i'm stuck with jekyll, unless github changes their backend :)
15:06 jimi_c       the main annoyance with them is they force running in --safe mode, which means i have to pre-generate dynamic content before pushing it up to their repo
15:09 semiosis     @lucky octopress
15:09 crimsonfubot semiosis: http://octopress.org/
15:09 semiosis     (for pdurbin :)
15:09 semiosis     i guess it's just jekyll with some preset themes &amp; features
15:10 * semiosis   runs in --danger mode
15:12 jimi_c       me too, i wrote a whole bunch of plugins to do cool stuff and then found out i couldn't use them :/
15:12 jimi_c       https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler.github.com/tree/master/_plugins
15:13 jimi_c       ^ what i use for cobbler.github.com/manuals/
15:14 jimi_c       yeah looking at octopress it looks like they rewrote it to use jekyll recently
15:15 * jimi_c     may have to check that out
15:15 semiosis     its been a while already
15:16 jimi_c       oh yeah by recently i mean within a couple of years, i see a lot of the docs have 2011 on them
15:17 semiosis     hehe
15:21 jimi_c       this is much easier than my process: http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/
15:23 jimi_c       right now, i run a script i wrote to generate dynamic content under my _dynamic folder, followed by an rsync to copy the generated content into place, followed by "git add"s for all the new changes (including the pre and post generated dynamic content) followed by a git push
16:31 pdurbin      jimi_c: http://octopress.org/docs/deploying/github/ is interesting but if i'm going to generate a site locally before pushing it to GitHub Pages, I'll just use ikiwiki, which is awesome. would that GitHub Pages supported ikiwiki :)
16:34 pdurbin      i wonder if http://www.anandtech.com/tag/Podcast is any good. via http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/97
16:42 jimi_c       pdurbin: when using vagrant + veewee, is it faster to turn hostiocache on? any other tips on speeding up disk performance? I haven't used vbox much
16:42 jimi_c       my cobbler import tests are disk heavy, and are taking quite a while under vbox :/
16:47 semiosis     meh, ordered a galaxy note ii from tmo yesterday and now the order status says backordered
17:17 pdurbin      jimi_c: sorry, i don't know. one of the centos base boxes i tried booted quickly and the other didn't. not sure why
17:17 pdurbin      semiosis: careful with the samsung vulnerability, as i warned rackerhacker: https://plus.google.com/101646943125332675164/posts/Ja7C7RpPzNU
17:18 pdurbin      semiosis: also, i've been a tmo customer for a week or so. taking some notes here for now: http://wiki.greptilian.com/vendors/t-mobile
17:32 jimi_c       pdurbin: virtual ssd :)
17:33 jimi_c       i'll fire up a vm later and try some of the usual tricks while running a disk benchmark
17:33 jimi_c       the n40L i'm running this on just has the one disk, so i'm sure that's not helping
17:56 pdurbin      jimi_c: ok
17:58 pdurbin      if anyone local to boston wants to sit with me and help me root and android phone and put cyanogen mod on it for the first time, please let me know. i'm thinking about contacting http://www.meetup.com/boston-android/ to see if it's something they do
17:58 pdurbin      this is the phone i have and i don't much care for whatever skin HTC has put on it: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-Mobile_myTouch_4G
18:00 pdurbin      the mytouch 4G seems to be well supported by cyanogenmod: http://wiki.cyanogenmod.org/wiki/TMobile_myTouch_3G:_Rooting
18:04 semiosis     pdurbin: thanks for the info.  i'm doign that same plan
18:40 pdurbin      has anyone looked into Google+ Communities? i'm intruiged by them but i'm concerned about data liberation as i posted here: https://plus.google.com/114723964985237592593/posts/NAnQhJ8awDj . these days i don't want to put my data into anything that won't give it back
18:41 pdurbin      this give me doubt the Google+ Communities can be accessed via an official API: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13761665/grabbing-lists-of-members-of-google-communities
18:41 pdurbin      maybe i'll look into using http://vanillaforums.org instead
18:47 pdurbin      this would be for a non-technical community. parents of kids at my daughter's school
18:48 pdurbin      i prefer Q&amp;A sites usually but a forum might be better for them
18:49 pdurbin      maybe i should run my own irc network and log it. :) ... not that i know anything about running an irc network
18:59 semiosis     realistically you'd just run a server, not a network
19:00 semiosis     but i wouldnt recommend it
19:05 semiosis     so, best android irc client?  yaaic?
19:05 semiosis     was there consensus on this recently?
21:02 pdurbin      semiosis: you could also try andchat: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-12-27#i_6278044
23:18 pdurbin      more podcasts (i haven't heard of): http://www.edgecasesshow.com http://www.imore.com/tag/debug http://www.coreint.org via http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/97
