12:24 pdurbin    Can an "installer" be a person?
14:27 bene       sure
14:34 pdurbin    ok, but I still like "Installation Guide" better than "Installer's Guide"
14:57 pdurbin    "installer" redirects to http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Installation_%28computer_programs%29#Installer
14:57 pdurbin    bene: so maybe I disagree with you :)
15:08 bene       when i try to find the meaning of a word, i use a dictionary
15:08 bene       i don't think it matters what you call this thing you're writing as long as the actually installation docs are clear and concise
15:10 pdurbin    what if all you have is the definition? such as "someone who installs software" :)
15:16 bene       i'm not really sure i follow you
15:16 bene       but i'm also not really sure i care
15:16 bene       :-)
19:12 semiosis   so i've been using google keep since it came out, but recently tried switching over to evernote and have been pretty disappointed with it.  can anyone suggest an alternative?
19:13 semiosis   ideally something with native apps for android, ios, and mac, plus a web interface
