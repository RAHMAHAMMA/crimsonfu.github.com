15:33 LyndsySimon Greetings. pdurbin suggested I drop this link in this channel: https://www.yubico.com/2014/10/neo-u2f-key-apps/
15:34 LyndsySimon It's regarding U2F, an emerging standard for multi-factor authentication. Google annouced support for it yesterday.
15:35 LyndsySimon Unlike "traditional" TOTP, U2F means that each service you authenticate to gets its own keypair. I've not dug deeply into yet, but I plan to implement it within the next week or two for a Python webapp.
15:42 pdurbin     LyndsySimon: speaking of Python and TOTP, I forget if I ever linked you to https://github.com/fasrc/openauth
15:43 LyndsySimon I don't think so. I ended up using a fairly low-level library

15:55 hydrajump   LyndsySimon: thanks for the U2F link!
