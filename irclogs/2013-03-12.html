12:20 pdurbin      my group got renamed from Product Development to Data Science: http://www.iq.harvard.edu/filter_by/staff/data-science
12:21 pdurbin      in other news: Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century - Harvard Business Review - http://hbr.org/2012/10/data-scientist-the-sexiest-job-of-the-21st-century ;)
12:53 rackerhacker you should get it changed to "big data scientist"
12:53 rackerhacker big data was the big buzzword at rsa
12:54 pdurbin      we've moved on to "very big data" http://dataprivacylab.org/TIP/schedule.html#talk3 ;)
12:58 pdurbin      in the cloud ;)
13:01 rackerhacker buzzword bingo ;)
13:02 pdurbin      we're leveraging synergies
13:21 rackerhacker like a boss
13:24 pdurbin      lol
18:43 StripeyType  If people haven't yet looked, but are interested in (either or both) crowdfunded technology and modern, move-able home alarm systems, check out scoutalarm.com. Mostly I'm pimping because I want to see them get funded, but the blog also has some very interesting posts about crowdfunding a project in general.
18:47 pdurbin      StripeyType: can you please make it clickable from the log?
19:19 StripeyType  http://www.acoutalarm.com/
19:19 StripeyType  (it isn't clear to me whether or not that is sufficient)
19:20 pdurbin      StripeyType: sorry, i mean from http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2013-03-12
19:20 pdurbin      i think of the log as the artifact we're building here
19:22 StripeyType  sure -I know which log you mean, but I don't know how the parser behaves, or if it requires some manual intervention on my part. is putty a full URI sufficient?
19:22 StripeyType  s/putty/putting/
19:23 StripeyType  (at least, it seems to be as that is not a clickable link)
19:23 StripeyType  s/not/now/
19:23 pdurbin      yes, full url please :)
19:25 semiosis     http://www.scoutalarm.com
19:25 semiosis     typo fixo
19:25 StripeyType  oooh. good catch. I am still unused to mac keyboards. thanks.
19:50 JoeJulian    re: big data titles, how about Very Large Scale Data (VLSD) Scientist. That sounds like something you could get a doctorate in.
19:51 pdurbin      :)
19:54 JoeJulian    A VLSDE (Engineer) would be the science of designing systems that capture, store, retrieve, etc. VLSD. The VLSDS would be the science of applying that data to some practical use.
21:42 comptona     JoeJulian: I think you'd rapidly run into quibbles about the definition of Very Large Scale
21:44 JoeJulian    Thos aren't quibbles, they're academic papers. ;)
22:23 pdurbin      speaking of data and practical use, i thought this was a neat visualization: Interactive Visualization of Streaming Data with Kernel Density Estimation - YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N5kg_tcG1s
22:24 pdurbin      the next big thing after big data is real time data :)
22:29 agoddard     real big time data
22:29 semiosis     pdurbin: have you seen storm?
22:30 semiosis     http://storm-project.net/ &lt;-- real time big data
22:49 pdurbin      hmm
22:49 pdurbin      remind me to show this to ventz, please
22:49 pdurbin      oh, i saw a bot in #unhosted that takes memos
22:50 pdurbin      you send a memo to someone and when they sign back into the irc network the bot sends them a private message with the memo
22:53 semiosis     @later tell pdurbin crimsonfubot can do that
22:53 crimsonfubot semiosis: Error: "later" is not a valid command.
22:54 semiosis     @load later
22:54 crimsonfubot semiosis: Error: You don't have the owner capability. If you think that you should have this capability, be sure that you are identified before trying again. The 'whoami' command can tell you if you're identified.
22:54 semiosis     pdurbin: say "@load later" and crimsonfubot will have the ability
22:55 semiosis     if you're authed anyway
23:01 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: load later
23:01 crimsonfubot pdurbin: Error: You don't have the owner capability. If you think that you should have this capability, be sure that you are identified before trying again. The 'whoami' command can tell you if you're identified.
23:32 JoeJulian    umount /tftpboot/images/centos; "Ok, arrow all the way down to the bottom and press enter on Boot from Hard Disk." in.tftpd[15683]: RRQ from 10.21.0.113 filename images/centos/6...  --- &lt;sigh&gt;
