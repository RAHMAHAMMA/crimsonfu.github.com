22:55 pdurbin      melodie: cool. but you said I can announce here the local even that's related to it, right?
22:55 pdurbin      event*
22:56 melodie      of course, haven't you yet?
22:56 melodie      I explain to you why it matters to me.
22:57 melodie      I had the idea, none around me in the chans or forums had any talk about it, didn't seem to have any thoughts about it. So I would like very much that the closest buddies and little communities in the French speaking area make it their message, first, as remote supporters
22:57 pdurbin      nope. hey Boston-area people: remarks from GNU founder Richard Stallman. September 28 and 29, 2013 at MIT in Cambridge, Massachusetts -- GNU 30th anniversary celebration and hackathon - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation - https://www.gnu.org/gnu30/celebration
22:58 pdurbin      I'd go but I'll be in San Francisco
22:59 melodie      while we are here, the little communities that we are would be happy if someone going accepts to be our 'porte-parole' there for our wishes
22:59 melodie      to bring our wishes...
22:59 pdurbin      I read that as "party patrol" :)
