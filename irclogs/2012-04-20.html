12:55 pdurbin     SEJeff_work: this is probably the recent article full of php hate you're thinking of: PHP: a fractal of bad design - fuzzy notepad - http://me.veekun.com/blog/2012/04/09/php-a-fractal-of-bad-design/
12:55 pdurbin     i linked to it from https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/EEEznRbhN7Q
12:59 pdurbin     here's some public info on openauth, our new two factor authentication system i'm so excited about: http://rc.fas.harvard.edu/openauth
13:45 matt1337357 pdurbin: hmm. that article is interesting
13:45 matt1337357 i feel i want to disagree with it, but the author is arguing things that I agree with
13:46 matt1337357 it's obnoxiously written but correct.
13:48 matt1337357 I really think everything should be html5 now
13:48 matt1337357 and we just slip in php for tiny scripts called via ajax
13:48 matt1337357 i'm sick of php frameworks
14:36 pdurbin     PHP is the working man's language: http://wiki.twit.tv/wiki/FLOSS_Weekly_37
14:40 pdurbin     "I want people to be able to take this software and install it on their own servers. And in fact I want them to be able to install it on the cheapest, rattiest, $2.98 a month, safe_mode PHP system out there. I would love to have it as easy and ubiquitous as WordPress, something that people can put up on cheap, cheap systems and push it out there."
15:13 matt1337357 well - success
15:13 pdurbin     success?
15:13 matt1337357 as in - php does just that
15:14 pdurbin     yeah, thinkup has the same philosophy. i stood it up recently: http://thinkup.greptilian.com/?v=tweets&amp;u=philipdurbin&amp;n=twitter
15:26 matt1337357 hm
