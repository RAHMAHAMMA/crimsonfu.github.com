19:59 agoddard   http://ceph.com/wiki/Rbd
20:36 pdurbin    mmm, ceph
20:36 pdurbin    has come up a couple times... http://irclog.perlgeek.de/search.pl?channel=crimsonfu&amp;nick=&amp;q=ceph
20:37 * comptona is using ceph for a new openstack deployment at $work
20:37 pdurbin    comptona: do tell! :)
20:38 comptona   basically following http://www.sebastien-han.fr/blog/2012/06/10/introducing-ceph-to-openstack/
20:38 comptona   although I haven't gotten the authentication bit sorted yet
20:38 comptona   I'm using centos 6, and I spent a couple of days trying to get a version of qemu-kvm that was new enough to support ceph
20:39 comptona   now that it's working though, it seems really smooth and seems to work pretty well
20:39 comptona   I still need to test some of the more advanced use cases like fault tolerance and live migration
20:39 pdurbin    ventz: aren't you using kvm 1.0?
21:08 agoddard   comptona: u using ceph to store VM images?
21:08 comptona   not yet, but that's part of the plan
21:08 comptona   I wanted to get volumes nailed down first
21:11 agoddard   nice. what are you migrating from, storage wise?
21:14 comptona   nothing; this is a new system
21:33 agoddard   cool. I'd love to hear how it goes
21:34 comptona   I'm going to try to get permission to write up a big blog post for $company_tech_blog once I'm done
21:34 comptona   in particular, getting it running on centos was super tricky and I'd like to save other people the trouble
21:34 agoddard   sweet
