02:58 * pdurbin    looks at the perl, eval, json thing again: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2013-02-19#i_6472566
02:59 pdurbin      larsks: you're right that eval can and is used for exception handling in perl. i typically don't use eval for this... i write "or die" a lot
03:00 pdurbin      i've heard this is a nice way to use exceptions: http://search.cpan.org/dist/Try-Tiny/
03:00 pdurbin      ironcamel: probably from you :)
03:01 pdurbin      SEJeff_work: i still don't understand why you need eval to convert json to a perl data structure though
03:01 pdurbin      perl -e 'use JSON; use Data::Dumper; my $valid_json = q{{"foo": "bar"}}; my $hashref = from_json($valid_json); print Dumper $hashref'
03:01 pdurbin      that will die if you make the json invalid
03:03 pdurbin      oh, an one last thing about eval. i think i just had a gut reaction to eval. i guess i was thinking about how "string eval" is frowned upon by perlcritic: Perl::Critic::Policy::BuiltinFunctions::ProhibitStringyEval - search.cpan.org - http://search.cpan.org/dist/Perl-Critic/lib/Perl/Critic/Policy/BuiltinFunctions/ProhibitStringyEval.pm
04:07 ironcamel    he could have also done my $Data = eval { $JSONObject-&gt;decode($ReturnData) };
04:07 ironcamel    by he, i mean SEJeff_work. eval returns the last thing evaluated in the block.
04:46 pdurbin      ironcamel: hmm. ok
04:46 pdurbin      now i feel bad that i only jumped back in here to link to this: This Open-Source, Robotic Tentacle Will Haunt Your Dreams | TechCrunch - http://techcrunch.com/2013/02/11/this-open-source-robotic-tentacle-will-haunt-your-dreams/
04:46 pdurbin      :)
13:42 SEJeff_work  pdurbin, ironcamel morning gents!
13:43 SEJeff_work  It turned out not to actually be the eval that was blowing up. I had a 200 line git diff for that to clean it up enough so that use strict/warnings would even execute. Just trying to make some ugly code go and it ended up being something above that which was throwing me off.
13:43 pdurbin      SEJeff_work: cool
13:44 SEJeff_work  And I've been forced to be a polyglot programmer at this new job. Perl, php, lots of python, and... golang!
13:49 pdurbin      mmm, go. do you like it?
14:10 larsks       SEJeff_work: Where are you working?
14:11 SEJeff_work  larsks, A finance company in Chicago
14:11 larsks       Spiffy.
14:11 SEJeff_work  pdurbin, I like how it is smack in the middle of python and c
14:12 SEJeff_work  It does make the concurrency issues of python go away and goroutines make it quite trivial to take a single threaded design and parallelize it. I'm a fan so far.
14:19 pdurbin      SEJeff_work: cool. oh, hey, you've been gone a while [glad you're ok ;) ] ... I started a new channel: http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/today
14:20 SEJeff_work  heh
14:21 pdurbin      :)
14:21 SEJeff_work  You sir love your irc logs
14:23 pdurbin      it's better than twitter
14:23 pdurbin      SEJeff_work: have you used solr at all?
14:23 SEJeff_work  Not a fan
14:23 SEJeff_work  elasticsearch all the way
14:23 pdurbin      :/
14:23 SEJeff_work  EL &gt; solr
14:24 pdurbin      i'm trying to add solr to our webapp: Dataverse Network - Feature #2656: Solr for DVN search - Project Management at IQSS, Harvard University - https://redmine.hmdc.harvard.edu/issues/2656
14:25 SEJeff_work  Why not use elasticsearch? Setting up a ES cluster is much much easier. It is as easy as riak. Add another node to the ring by pointing it at any existing member and it configures itsself and rebalances work
14:25 SEJeff_work  Both solr and es are lucene based if I recall
14:29 SEJeff_work  pdurbin, This is actually pretty non-biased. If you need to scale out, it really sucks with solr in comparison to es: http://solr-vs-elasticsearch.com/
14:40 SEJeff_work  Has anyone used: http://git-deploy.github.com ?
14:46 pdurbin      SEJeff_work: yes, both are lucene-based. i did mention ES in update #2 on that ticket ^^. i dunno, solr feels a little more tried and true, I guess. I only just moved the project from svn to https://github.com/iqss/dvn
14:46 SEJeff_work  To each their own
14:46 SEJeff_work  I found solr used up a lot of memory and got an es cluster up in running in about 10 minutes
14:47 SEJeff_work  Then I threw a ton of syslog data at it with graylog2 and logstash (check those projects out if you have some time)
14:47 SEJeff_work  I never looked back
14:47 pdurbin      agoddard: you're forever talking about those projects
14:47 SEJeff_work  because they are amazing :P
14:47 SEJeff_work  Neither compare to splunk granted, but they are free
14:48 pdurbin      SEJeff_work: dunno much about git-deploy but i did link it up here: https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/VnFeuMEqGEn
14:49 SEJeff_work  My use case is pushing 2-3 webapps to central sites that are then replicated out automatically to the various slave appservers
14:49 pdurbin      SEJeff_work: did you set up a custom schema for ES? that's what i'm working on now: https://github.com/dvn/solrpoc
14:49 SEJeff_work  pdurbin, es is schemaless
14:49 SEJeff_work  Again... much much easier to get going and usable than solr
14:50 pdurbin      oh yeah, i forgot. :)
14:50 SEJeff_work  pdurbin, Just read the front page: http://www.elasticsearch.org
14:52 pdurbin      right
14:54 SEJeff_work  Oh and using git-deploy, I don't git push to the production servers. I made it use rsync
15:00 pdurbin      96 nicks in #solr, 235 in #elasticsearch
15:03 pdurbin      now that i'm actually dinking with a solr schema the idea of schema-less seems attractive :)
15:05 SEJeff_work  Yeah I see es vs solr much like salt vs puppet: https://www.ohloh.net/p/compare?project_0=salt&amp;project_1=opscode-chef&amp;project_2=Puppet
15:06 SEJeff_work  salt is the config management / remote execution tool I hack on in free time.
15:06 SEJeff_work  saltstack.org
15:06 pdurbin      es is more active that solr, you mean?
15:07 SEJeff_work  The community and traction, yeah
15:07 pdurbin      yeah. we're thinking about moving from hudson to jenkins for this reason
15:07 SEJeff_work  ha!
15:07 SEJeff_work  All of the hudson devs moved to jenkins almost
15:07 pdurbin      yeah
15:09 SEJeff_work  http://www.ohloh.net/p/compare?project_0=elasticsearch&amp;project_1=Apache+Solr
15:09 pdurbin      solr has more activity :)
15:11 SEJeff_work  es is hands down the underdog. solr is the entrenched player
15:11 SEJeff_work  Both will more than work for what you're trying to do. Go with what you like the best
15:12 SEJeff_work  I've had great exp with logstash + elasticsearch
15:12 pdurbin      semiosis: you're a fan of ES too: http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2012-12-11#i_796
15:13 SEJeff_work  pdurbin, speaking of reportlab...
15:14 SEJeff_work  pdurbin, I know the guy who wrote this, pretty decent stuff: http://blingalytics.readthedocs.org/en/latest/
15:15 pdurbin      reportlab?
15:19 SEJeff_work  http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2012-12-11#i_791
15:38 pdurbin      ah
17:35 larsks|phone hmm. an iPhone irc client without server push is only mildly useful.
