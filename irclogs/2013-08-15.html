02:24 mhayden      ksplice has some ups and downs
10:04 pdurbin      mhayden: you aren't a fan? kplice seemed to "just work" for the year or so that I used it
13:25 mhayden      i get a little nervous with the types of operations that ksplice does to get its work done
13:38 pdurbin      mhayden: heh. you should :)
13:38 mhayden      :)
13:38 mhayden      i'm migrating back to linux over the next few weeks... again ;)
13:39 mhayden      but i think i figured out why i ended up back on OS X before
13:39 mhayden      one half of it is microsoft office but the other half is that i need to get more "minimal" about what i do on a computer ;)
13:41 pdurbin      you should only need a shell ;)
13:42 semiosis     anyone use travis-ci?
13:44 pdurbin      semiosis: no but guys in our department do: https://travis-ci.org/openscholar/openscholar
13:45 semiosis     wondering how people get data out of it when things fail.  thinking about pushing a shell script that just does a recrusive cat so all the output files (with test failures) get dumped to the log
13:46 semiosis     there's no easy way (afaict) to dig into the workspace like with jenkins
13:47 pdurbin      is it possible to host your own travis?
13:47 semiosis     if i were going to host my own i would use jenkins & sonarqube, but i would rather not host my own, so trying travis & coveralls
13:48 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky travis coveralls
13:48 crimsonfubot pdurbin: https://coveralls.io/docs/ruby
13:48 semiosis     test coverage reports
13:49 semiosis     google sonarqube
13:49 crimsonfubot http://www.sonarqube.org/
13:49 semiosis     sonar is amazing
13:49 semiosis     s/sonar/sonarqube/ -- they renamed it
13:50 semiosis     i can't imagine coveralls being that good, but want to try it anyway
13:54 pdurbin      semiosis: so basically you want data liberation from travis ci?
13:55 semiosis     +1k
13:55 semiosis     couldn't have said it better
13:56 * semiosis   wonders if an ec2 micro instance has enough power for jenkins, sonarqube, and nexus
13:57 semiosis     bbiab
14:04 joshu        mhayden you moving from OS X to linux?
14:19 mhayden      joshu: yeah
14:19 mhayden      i want to get to where i work out of a browser, terminal, IM client mainly
14:19 mhayden      which will be a challenge
14:19 mhayden      :)
14:20 joshu        mhayden ok nothing to do with closed-source PRISM/ NSA stuff?
14:22 mhayden      not really
14:22 mhayden      just fed up with the mac
14:22 mhayden      and i don't use anything apple-ish other than my mac
14:22 mhayden      no appletv, iphone, ipad, etc
14:25 joshu        I understand. What linux flavour you going to use?
14:25 mhayden      most likely fedora
14:25 mhayden      possibly mint, but probably fedora
14:29 joshu        will you run this on your Mac as the host OS or will you ditch the Mac for some other make?
14:31 * pdurbin    is happy enough with fedora
15:16 semiosis     try kde
21:40 JoeJulian    Commenting on this morning's conversation that I'm just catching up with. I'm with mhayden. My screens are generally covered with a browser, 2 half-screen terminals, as small of a thunderbird window as I can manage, and about a 1/4 screen window for xchat. IM (Empathy) pops up as needed.
