16:41 dotplus   do we have any bcfg2 people here?
17:21 * pdurbin looks at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bcfg2
17:53 dotplus   not sure whether I'm going to like it or not, but it's what $newjob has and we ain't changing any time soon
17:54 dotplus   I need to learn it and one of the services I will be putting under its control as a learning project will be cobbler
17:55 * jimi_c  's ears pick up
17:59 jimi_c    dotplus: let me know if you have cobbler questions, can't help with the bcfg2 though
18:00 jimi_c    but in 1 week I'll be officially employed by AnsibleWorks so if you decide to rip it out let me know ;)
18:03 dotplus   jimi_c: thanks, I will, but it looks like they have a very boring cobbler install. interesting. is ansible going to keep you on cobbler? where are you leaving for ansible?
18:28 jimi_c    i'm currently at Savvis, working as a contractor
18:28 jimi_c    no plans currently for cobbler, so it'll remain my side-project (#secondjob)
