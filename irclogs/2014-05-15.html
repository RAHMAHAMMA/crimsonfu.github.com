00:24 westmaas  seems like that site isn't very good for crowdfunding
00:24 westmaas  in my unbiased opinion
00:26 pdurbin   westmaas: what do you know about crowd funding ;)
00:27 westmaas  haha
00:28 pdurbin   westmaas: how come you and ironcamel aren't on the company web page?
00:28 westmaas  we are secret weapons
00:29 pdurbin   westmaas: are you shock or awe?
00:29 westmaas  hah
00:30 westmaas  ironcamel got a special mention on the last blog post: http://engineering.crowdtilt.com/
00:31 pdurbin   wow. awesome AND relevant
00:32 westmaas  haha
00:33 pdurbin   westmaas: how's perl treatin' you?
00:34 westmaas  ok so far, but I haven't been getting my hands too dirty in code yes
00:34 westmaas  yet*
00:34 pdurbin   ah. #directorfu
00:35 westmaas  exactly
00:58 ironcamel lol
00:59 ironcamel i think all westmaas does is go to meetings
00:59 ironcamel meetings for scheduling more meetings
01:02 pdurbin   so sick of meetings
01:03 pdurbin   ironcamel: yes, nice quote from you at the end: http://engineering.crowdtilt.com/never-ever-use-perl/
01:05 ironcamel haha, thanks
01:06 ironcamel that was born from my frustration with people hating on perl.
02:34 pdurbin   yeah, no need to hate
02:34 pdurbin   "You donâ€™t have to profess hate for one thing in order to express love for another."
03:07 westmaas  ironcamel: I hate your hatred of meetings
17:59 codex     hydrajump: sorry - didn't have a lot of time to go through it. Will look this weekend
18:09 pdurbin   sigh
18:09 pdurbin   I need `jq` but for XML
18:10 * pdurbin looks again at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/91791/grep-and-sed-equivalent-for-xml-command-line-processing
18:14 larsks    pdurbin: What about xpath?  xmlint --xpath //some/query < myfile.xml
18:14 larsks    Err, "xmllint"
18:16 pdurbin   larsks: I've been trying but it seems buggy
18:17 pdurbin   believe me, I'm looking at http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2224613/how-do-you-use-the-pattern-option-of-xmllint
18:18 larsks    pdurbin: usually works for me.  Got an example that's not working?
18:19 larsks    E.g., this works: virsh net-dumpxml default | xmllint --xpath '//range[@start="192.168.122.2"]' -
18:19 pdurbin   larsks: here you go: atom statement Dancebin! - http://danceb.in/hnmscF3c4xGMZvHQvceTbw

18:20 larsks    whoop. flakey yubikey.
18:20 pdurbin   heh. no worries
18:20 pdurbin   this kinda does what I want:
18:20 pdurbin   curl -s http://danceb.in/hnmscF3c4xGMZvHQvceTbw/raw | xpath '//entry/title'
18:21 pdurbin   BUT
18:21 pdurbin   since I'm on os x, I get these annoying "-- NODE --" and "Found 2 nodes" messages
18:21 Whoop     larsks: my yubikey isn't flakey, thanks ;)
18:21 pdurbin   more on that os x problem here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7797795/why-is-sed-not-able-to-process-piped-output-from-xpath
18:22 larsks    So...it's working, but you don't like the format of the output?
18:22 pdurbin   right
18:22 pdurbin   since I'm on os x, I get these annoying "-- NODE --" and "Found 2 nodes" messages
18:23 pdurbin   there's no -q option on os x
18:23 pdurbin   (for /usr/bin/xpath)
18:29 pdurbin   hmm. maybe I'll just hack /usr/bin/xpath5.12 a bit
18:32 pdurbin   yeah. that works :)
18:34 larsks    Yay!
18:34 pdurbin   westmaas: see? perl. love it :)
18:38 pdurbin   my answer: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7797795/why-is-sed-not-able-to-process-piped-output-from-xpath/23686186#23686186
18:38 pdurbin   because otherwise `xpath` is a handy tool
18:53 whorka    pdurbin: curl -s http://danceb.in/hnmscF3c4xGMZvHQvceTbw/raw | xpath '//entry/title' 2>/dev/null
18:54 pdurbin   whorka: right. yes, but then I miss the newlines :(
18:57 pdurbin   I did take a quick look at xmlstarlet but it seemed... complicated
19:05 pdurbin   right. this even works. nice: xpath '//entry/id/text()'
19:06 pdurbin   maybe xml isn't so bad after all
19:16 pdurbin   ah ha. this works too: curl -s http://danceb.in/hnmscF3c4xGMZvHQvceTbw/raw | xmlstarlet sel -t -v //_:entry/_:title
19:16 pdurbin   per the namespace warning/message: None of the XPaths matched; to match a node in the default namespace use '_' as the prefix (see section 5.1 in the manual). For instance, use /_:node instead of /node
20:16 hydrajump larks you like the yubikey? I've heard about it and one called ironkey, but have not used either product.
20:17 larsks    hydrajump: ironkey is, I think, a completely different sort of product.  yubikey is a hardware token; ironkey is an encrypted usb flash drive.  Or at least, I think.
20:17 larsks    At my work we use two-factor auth, and I'm using the yubikey for that.  It works great.
20:18 larsks    I have the yubikey "nano", which basically fits inside a USB port and can be left in semi-permanently.
20:18 larsks    We're using LinOTP as the backend.
20:19 larsks    We can use either hardware tokens (like the yubikey) or software tokens (like google authenticator).
20:21 whorka    larsks you are completely right about the ironkey being an encrypted USB flash drive (we have several)
20:24 hydrajump whorka: You like them?
20:32 larsks    hydrajump: We had a few ironkeys when I was at Harvard.  They seemed nice.  They sure where impenetrable when we lost the password :)
20:34 whorka    yeah, they're good for what we use them for. supported under RHEL/CentOS.
20:35 hydrajump Cool the only other alternative I've come across is Lok-it http://www.lok-it.net/
20:39 whorka    "washing machine cycles will not damage LOK-IT security or the data" <- best feature
20:46 hydrajump old review of ironkey but interesting https://www.ethicalhacker.net/columns/murray/review-pen-tester-sets-sites-on-the-ironkey
20:46 hydrajump " quality of their team (mostly sourced with product people from Apple and various professionals from the InfoSec world), "

21:00 larsks    Oh look, here I am already.
