20:19 codex        ironcamel: got an apache suexec question for you. I am using 'puppet' for the user/group for suexec, for a specific vhost - trying to get 'puppet module install puppetlabs/stdlib' for example to run. It doesn't seem t work, but if i do 'su - puppet' and run it then, it works perfectly. It doesn't really make sense
20:19 codex        pdurbin said you have used suexec/know a bit about it
20:20 ironcamel    codex: sorry, i have no idea. magoo, do you have a clue ^^^ ?
