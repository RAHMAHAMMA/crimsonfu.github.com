13:30 dotplus   this is why I love IRC
22:30 pdurbin   should I register an XML namespace? and if so, should I register with http://purl.org ?
23:03 melodie   pdurbin purl looks like a great idea!
23:04 melodie   would you take a moment when available to drop a work about it at the linuxvillage forum?
23:04 melodie   a word (not a work)
23:47 pdurbin   yeah but is it necessary? can I just use xmlns="" (blank) in elements I'm adding? I assume XML people frown upon this?
