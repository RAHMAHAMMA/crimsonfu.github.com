14:03 joshu_   hi how do you use git to clone an svn repo such as this: http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/user/cperciva/EC2-build/
14:03 joshu_   I tried doing git svn clone http://svnweb.freebsd.org/base/user/cperciva/EC2-build/ but that didn't work
18:09 _boegel_ joshu_: try svn:// ?
18:17 joshu_   _boegel_ I ended up installing svn on a virtual machine and that worked. I'll try with svn:// with git now
18:22 _boegel_ joshu_: just a stupid guess :)
