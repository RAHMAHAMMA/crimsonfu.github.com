13:54 melodie my guess is some people here must have great knowledge about networks, DNS primary and secondary servers, that kind of thing?
13:54 melodie we might use some help for a project using the eu.org tld
13:56 melodie :)
13:56 melodie if anyone feels he might help please ping me?
20:04 melodie hi
20:04 melodie does someone know how to configure a ns1 with bind? and what a handle is?
22:24 pdurbin typically someone else has already configured BIND and I just come along and tweak the zone files
22:25 pdurbin melodie: I think of a handle as not so much a DNS thing as a library/publishing identifier thing: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Handle_System
22:28 melodie hi pdurbin
22:28 pdurbin handles, to me, are like this: http://hdl.handle.net/1902.1/11252
