15:03 dotplus      did something happen in ##infra-talk? I haven't looked in there recently until just now. And there's no activity. According to my client, nothing for weeks, yet it claims 428 nicks in the channel.
16:19 pdurbin      I haven't been in there for years.
16:46 dotplus      well, are you still an infra chap?
16:46 dotplus      unsurprisingly, it turns out my problem was pebkac. fat fingered a /ignore
16:48 pdurbin      less so these days. this is my most recent infra project: https://github.com/IQSS/plaid
16:48 dotplus      I don't pay much attention, but occasionally I have found utility there. I think that was where I first heard about test kitchen or vagrant or something
