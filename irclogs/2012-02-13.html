14:56 shuff    hey hey :)
15:23 Pax      has anyone written any custom facts to get primary interface name?

15:32 shuff    btw, Pax: rob and i should shortly have a patch to submit to your pam_access puppet module :)
15:32 Pax      oh, cool, what did you add?
15:34 shuff    we're parameterizing it
15:34 shuff    we would like to use it to manage pam_access on our own systems
15:35 Pax      oh! do a quick check out, I actually did that already, see if it matches up!
15:35 Pax      I did a really quick job of it though, so improvements would be really welcome!
15:36 shuff    what's the svn url?
15:37 Pax      http://svn.noc.harvard.edu/puppet/
15:37 Pax      http://svn.noc.harvard.edu/puppet/trunk/modules/pam_access/
