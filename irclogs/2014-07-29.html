01:14 pdurbin   semiosis: talkin' about http://www.modulecounts.com with sivoais at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/pdl/2014-07-28 (and the next day of logs)
01:14 pdurbin   javascript has surpassed java
12:26 * dotplus starts final (short) week at $employer
12:27 pdurbin   dotplus: where to?
12:27 dotplus   metacloud.com
12:28 pdurbin   OpenStack Cloud Provider | Hosted Private Cloud - http://www.metacloud.com
12:28 pdurbin   cool
12:28 * pdurbin used to dink around with openstack... in the diablo days
12:28 dotplus   I hope so. I'm excited; it sounds very promising
12:31 dotplus   cool tech, fairly greenfield environment, startup (-ish, they've been around for a couple of years or so), more money, more vacation and work from home.
12:32 dotplus   get to learn openstack which I have a little experience with, and chef and ruby, neither of which I have any significant experience with yet.
12:34 pdurbin   dotplus: I bet comptona wouldn't mind if you ask an openstack question in here
12:34 pdurbin   and westmaas and ironcamel used to know something about it ;)
12:36 dotplus   Did comptona recently go work for opscode/chef or am I confusing him with someone else?
12:36 pdurbin   buh. not that I know of
12:39 dotplus   nope, someone else from another channel, which he also frequents.
12:39 * dotplus sends sigbart for trying to access invalid memory address
12:39 dotplus   sigbart. ha! I like that. "sigabrt"
12:40 dotplus   doh!
13:23 larsks    dotplus: you can also ask openstack questions on #openstack :)
13:25 dotplus   really? ya know, I've heard of that.
14:14 pdurbin   cool, I googled for "rotate google spreadsheet" and found this tip about TRANSPOSE: Convert a Row to a Column (or Backwards) in Google Docs Spreadsheets - http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/15810/convert-a-row-to-a-column-or-backwards-in-google-docs-spreadsheets/
14:14 pdurbin   works great
14:24 mhayden   pdurbin: westmaas forgot about openstack :P
15:35 pdurbin   how could he
15:35 pdurbin   unpossible
16:36 JoeJulian forgot openstack?
16:37 JoeJulian inconceivable!
16:41 JoeJulian I might know a thing or two about openstack, too, dotplus.
16:42 dotplus   I forget. are you another racker?
16:43 JoeJulian Nope, I'm a newly Principal Cloud Architect at IO. ( http://www.io.com )
16:46 pdurbin   JoeJulian: not io.io? ;)
16:46 JoeJulian I know, right!
16:46 dotplus   *I* successfully resisted that quip
16:46 JoeJulian cloud.io would be perfect, but no....
16:48 JoeJulian Hehe. Regarding .io: "Other than the Diego Garcia atoll, the territory has been uninhabited since the existing population was evacuated in 1973 and has no government of its own." - http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/.io
16:48 JoeJulian So they need a TLD?
16:56 JoeJulian Actually, after reading about the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chagossians and the fact that .io revenue goes to the British government, I no longer want a .io domain. I'd be tempted to call for a boycott even.
18:07 westmaas  I know things!
18:08 westmaas  dotplus: nice! congrats!
18:50 dotplus   westmaas: thanks, I'm chuffed.
