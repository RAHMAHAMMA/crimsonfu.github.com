21:49 pdurbin    what are the best open source video games?
21:50 pdurbin    asking for a friend: http://irclogs.jackgrigg.com/irc.freenode.net/openhatch/2014-11-22#i_3503966
22:04 prologic   oh hmm
22:04 prologic   there's quite a few good ones ihmo
22:04 prologic   tuxracer comes to mind :)
22:04 pdurbin    never heard of it. my kids love tuxpaint
22:08 prologic   https://gist.github.com/0d90549538158c76b033
22:08 prologic   https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/List_of_games
22:08 prologic   Arch probably have a beter list
22:09 pdurbin    prologic: you changed it to extremetuxracer ?
22:11 prologic   I believe upstream changed it
22:12 prologic   we (CRUX) normally create ports that directly match upstream software names
22:12 prologic   :)
22:13 prologic   I discovered how to Dockerize and run X11 apps last night
22:13 prologic   I even created a Bash alias fo simplifying how to ro it in one stroke :)
22:13 pdurbin    :)
22:14 prologic   alias dkix="docker run -i -t -e DISPLAY -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix -v $HOME/.Xauthority:/$HOME/.Xauthority --net=host"
22:15 pdurbin    nice
22:16 prologic   I don't really understand too much why the contanier needs to have access to the host's network stack
22:16 prologic   but anyway
22:16 prologic   it doesn't work without --net=host
22:17 pdurbin    probably the NSA put that in there
22:17 prologic   lol
22:18 * pdurbin  remembers when the NSA was hated only for creating SELinux
22:18 pdurbin    mhayden: ^^
22:20 prologic   heh
22:20 * prologic creates a crux/gtk image
22:20 prologic   to speed up creating X11 Dockerized apps :)
22:20 prologic   (at least based on GTK+)
22:20 prologic   :)
23:05 hydrajump  prologic: I haven't tried it myself but all the examples I've seen don't require --net=host
23:05 prologic   They do now :)
23:05 prologic   Docker 1.3.1 here
23:06 hydrajump  oh, have you tried just adding --cap-add=NET_ADMIN to see if that alone works?
23:07 prologic   no I haven't
23:07 prologic   but I'll try when I get back
23:07 prologic   I'm going to push up crux/gtk to the hub
23:07 prologic   and a simple demo app based on that
23:08 prologic   as a here's how to Dockerize X apps
23:08 prologic   bbl
