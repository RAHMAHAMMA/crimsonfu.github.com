17:30 semiosis i wonder how this would go in ruby
17:41 larsks   semiosis: wow, that is like a weird content-specific optimization :)
17:42 semiosis oh yeah, i forgot to mention in the paste, $a == $b evals true
17:44 semiosis arrays are funny in php
19:23 melodie  hello moviuro_ !
19:24 moviuro_ hi melodie ;)
19:24 melodie  moviuro_ ask your question, and be patient. You may have an answer many hours after, and you can get it by visiting the logs
19:24 melodie  (see the topic: logs at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/today )
19:25 melodie  pdurbin moviuro_ is an Archlinux user, and a student, I have recommanded #crimsonfu to him
19:26 moviuro_ Ok, thanks melodie for the "invitation" ;)
19:27 melodie  moviuro_ you are most welcome
19:27 melodie  moviuro_ in the meantime if you want you could pay a visit to http://crimsonfu.github.com
19:28 moviuro_ So I have the following issue with a Java/Hadoop Mapreduce issue: it seems to work fine but outputs lines like http://sprunge.us/MZUT & http://sprunge.us/EbaQ instead of a real count of words per "domain". Here is the code: I (double) checked the toString and method that populates the map, but don't find the mistake:http://sprunge.us/dBNg
19:32 melodie  semiosis and pdurbin have had talks about Java on the chan, I can see it in the logs.

19:35 melodie  moviuro_ I have one more idea, you can try #freeclass, at some times there are people very keen there
19:35 melodie  no
19:35 melodie  #free-class
19:35 melodie  sorry for the type
19:35 melodie  typo
19:35 melodie  my fingers don't work. :-(
19:36 semiosis could always try stack exchange
19:36 melodie  hi semiosis
19:36 semiosis hi
19:37 moviuro_ semiosis: actually, I'm not even sure it's hadoop related
19:38 moviuro_ perhaps a little mistake in my code that I oversaw (and, yes, I know the code is horrible, but this way, I only have to push one file on the server and launch the comilation)
20:50 pdurbin  wow. hadoop question. no idea
20:50 pdurbin  moviuro_: sorry :(
20:51 moviuro_ pdurbin: yeah, but I'm not even sure it is hadoop-related ;)
20:52 moviuro_ http://sprunge.us/JfFJ <- a bit updated code
