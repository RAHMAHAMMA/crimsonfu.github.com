19:26 bene    i need an LDAP server that will proxy auth requests to a SAML idP
19:27 bene    anyone built/bought/configured something like that?
19:27 bene    in theory a tool like http://www.gluu.org/ can do it
19:34 pdurbin there should be an #auth channel :)
20:03 pdurbin I did find http://www.gluu.org/blog/2-approaches-to-diy-single-sign-on-sso/ interesting the other day.
