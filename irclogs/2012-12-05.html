01:06 pdurbin      miah: i do! defaults for everything on server1.greptilian.com. anything non-default is in here: https://github.com/pdurbin/greptilian-vagrant ... am i doing it wrong? :)
02:20 miah         you are using puppet. so i dont think its all defaults.
03:20 pdurbin      fine. :)
15:42 pdurbin      meh. looked briefly at keepass but this convinced me to use `vim passwords.gpg` instead: Moving from KeePassX to CLI Password Safe using Vim and GPG | chrisjrob - http://chrisjrob.com/2011/05/04/moving-from-keepassx-to-cli-password-safe-using-vim-and-gpg/
18:43 * simmel     uses openssl.vim at home
18:49 miah         i keepass
20:04 larsks       pdurbin: I'm using keepassx, because iOS + Android + Linux + OS X.
20:05 larsks       ...and they all talk to my Dropbox account.
20:35 pdurbin      larsks: on fedora do you use https://admin.fedoraproject.org/pkgdb/acls/name/keepassx ?
20:35 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky openssl.vim
20:35 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2012
20:37 pdurbin      simmel: does this mean i can just run `ssh-add`, type the password for my ssh key, and then decrypt and see the contents in vim?
20:40 pdurbin      boegel: http://irclogger.com/.vagrant/2012-12-05#1354739941
20:52 larsks       pdurbin: Yup.
20:53 pdurbin      larsks: and is it gui only?
20:54 larsks       It is.  But that hasn't been a problem for me, because if I'm logged in remotely, then I'm running the application on my local machine instead.
20:55 boegel       pdurbin: ack
20:55 boegel       pdurbin: buh :(
20:56 larsks       Because seriously, when's the last time you logged in somewhere from a VT terminal?
20:56 pdurbin      i'm thinking
21:01 pdurbin      maybe i'll come around. i just like how simple this is
21:05 semiosis     http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Gp-RXCLO2M&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=58m3s
21:05 semiosis     OH that in ##infra-talk, quite good UNIX humor
21:34 semiosis     OH: &lt;bear&gt; wow, i'm going to go outside and hug a tree
21:34 semiosis     rofl
21:40 jimi_c       just got a random email from a facebook recruiter because of cobbler, anyone want a recommendation? :)
21:54 JoeJulian    Hehe, my resume's online. A facebook recruiter contacted me because of gluster. They had no idea who they were talking to, were offering me about a Sys Admin II and required me to send them my resume to go forward with starting the interview process. I told them the url. They told me that they require the applicant to send the resume in a doc or pdf format.
21:56 semiosis     they are so hungry
21:56 JoeJulian    Later, a more senior recruiter contacted me again asking if I knew anyone that was good with gluster that I would recommend. I told them to contact, essentially, Red Hat and told them how I didn't appreciate being asked to jump through stupid hoops. "Are you still interested?" he asked...
22:14 jimi_c       i just got a tour of mountain view from google, not sure if i want to fly out to CA again so soon :/
22:15 semiosis     i'd love to see how their interviews differ
22:16 jimi_c       i didn't find google's to be that bad honestly
22:21 semiosis     does google let engineers have offices?
22:22 semiosis     fb makes everyone work in big living rooms sprawled out on couches... what could be worse!?!?!
22:22 jimi_c       of the buildings i toured, it looked like everyone was in cubes, though i'm sure they wouldn't object if you sat around on a couch in the lounge all day with your laptop
22:23 jimi_c       they were very laid back cubes of course, not overly corporate
22:23 semiosis     no no, i mean, that would be so unproductive
22:23 semiosis     an office with a door is very important imho
22:27 jimi_c       yeah, i followed you :) i would be immensely distracted by all the comings and goings of people, i just meant it looked like only higher ups had offices at google, supervisors and whatnot
22:39 miah         offices are great. we have a open floor plan here. my desk is right next to my neighbor. we have no dividing walls.
22:39 miah         it can be distracting. headphones + focus is what i do
23:18 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky fogcreek private offices
23:18 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://www.joelonsoftware.com/items/2008/12/29.html
23:18 pdurbin      that's kind of fogcreek's thing
23:24 miah         ya
23:25 miah         https://twitter.com/i/#!/miah_/media/slideshow?url=pic.twitter.com%2FDikXcc5p
23:25 miah         how i roll at home
23:26 miah         my work desk isn't that great but we're moving in a few days to a new office
