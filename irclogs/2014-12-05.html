15:45 pdurbin    hmm. web is down for me but irc is ok. how about you, codex or whorka ? (and where did all the crimson people go?)
15:59 whorka     seems like it might be internal dns
16:00 * pdurbin  agrees
16:01 * pdurbin  wonders if 8.8.8.8 is still a thing
16:02 pdurbin    guess so. much better :)
17:13 pdurbin    whorka: yep. "DNS" http://services.huit.harvard.edu/status-dashboard/note/1586
20:30 tfhartmann anyone using consul or any other service discovery tools?
20:50 pdurbin    whoa. "Harvard University is experiencing internet outages across campus." http://www.harvard.edu/emergency
20:53 pdurbin    searchbot: lucky consul software
20:53 searchbot  pdurbin: http://www.consul.io/intro/vs/
20:55 pdurbin    huh. so vs. zookeeper, nagios, sensu and an bunch of things I've never heard of like Serf
20:56 pdurbin    tfhartmann: is it awesome?
20:57 tfhartmann well, so far I really like consul, I have a small 2 node server set up
20:57 tfhartmann er 3 node
20:58 tfhartmann trying to decide where all to use it, and how. My reason for setting it up at all was to use it for Docker container registration and discover
21:12 larsks     tfhartmann: hah, funny, I just booted up consul for the first time today.
21:13 tfhartmann larsks: great mind thing alike?
21:13 larsks     Somethink like that.
21:13 tfhartmann although my mind apparently can't type
21:14 larsks     I've also used just plain etcd for service registration/discovery.  I am partly interested in consul's "event" support.
21:18 tfhartmann oh hey... and I just noticed it has remote execution too... thats pretty spiff
21:48 larsks     Ooo, this is a good article.  It claims to be about Java, but it's not just about Java: http://www.jamesward.com/2014/12/03/java-doesnt-suck-youre-just-using-it-wrong
22:21 codex      pdurbin: yep
22:21 codex      pdurbin: there should've been a note or something
23:37 pdurbin    codex: a note to use 8.8.8.8? that tip spread like wildfire 'round here
