16:19 melodie   hi
16:19 melodie   is http://irclog.perlgeek.de down ? I can't reach http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage now
16:27 pdurbin   melodie: yes, it's down: http://colabti.org/irclogger/irclogger_log/perl6?date=2013-05-01#l113
16:27 melodie   hi pdurbin
16:32 pdurbin   hi
16:34 JoeJulian pdurbin: Is it not coming back?
16:38 semiosis  JoeJulian: pdurbin doesnt maintain it, and that link he gave suggests it will be back tomorrow
16:39 semiosis  looks like a server migration
16:40 melodie   pdurbin very good, thank you
17:05 pdurbin   yeah, I think moritz was using someone else's server. now he's getting his own
17:05 pdurbin   it's a nice service he runs... free IRC logging
17:07 melodie   yes, a very nice one
17:08 melodie   pdurbin how are things going these days ?
17:11 pdurbin   melodie: good. I'm thinking very hard about faceted search: http://dvn.github.io/devguide/features/search/faceted
17:14 melodie   do you have a short definition for faceted search ?
17:14 pdurbin   hmm, no, but here is my list of open source applications that have faceted search: http://wiki.greptilian.com/search/faceted/
17:15 pdurbin   if you click around under "faceted search example" you'll probably get an idea of it
17:15 pdurbin   regular search: http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/search/?q=jupiter
17:15 pdurbin   faceted search: http://labs.adsabs.harvard.edu/adsabs/search/?q=jupiter&amp;aut_f=0%2FClarke%2C+J
17:17 melodie   however a short definition would be good to have.
17:18 melodie   when I see your links I understand what it does, but when I don't have a definition it is hard for me to seek for an equivalent name in my language
17:22 pdurbin   melodie: http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recherche_%C3%A0_facettes
18:54 pdurbin   my tech talk got rescheduled for next week: http://iqss.github.io/vagrant-at-iqss
19:09 melodie   pdurbin from the page of your link : http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classification_%C3%A0_facettes this one is very interesting :)
19:12 pdurbin   melodie: if you like this stuff you would like this community: http://www.code4lib.org
19:12 melodie   I don't know how I could like it : it seems to be very important just to be able to use it
19:13 melodie   pdurbin I am working on a new version of ubuntu openbox remix
19:14 melodie   I have also brought together two important persons who are going to work together on the accessibility features in Openbox. the second person I brought is also bringing more people who have knowledge for this matter (ATK, at-spi and so on...)
19:14 melodie   going for dinner, bbl
19:34 pdurbin   codex: I just realized that moritz's bot (ilbot_bak) is in some channels like #gluster but not others (like this one)
19:35 codex     this is his new server? (replacement for the dead one?)
19:36 pdurbin   well, a new bot
19:41 pdurbin   dunno where it's running
19:43 codex     193.200.132.135
19:43 codex     perl6 in the netherlands
19:44 pdurbin   codex: you gonna leave the buttefly there? http://irclog.spacecompute.com/camelia.png
19:44 codex     if you have a better image, i am willing to replace it :)
19:45 pdurbin   http://irclog.greptilian.com/camelia.png
19:47 codex     changed
19:47 pdurbin   heh
19:54 pdurbin   codex: go make your own logo :)
19:59 codex     you made that?
20:01 pdurbin   yeah
20:01 pdurbin   in inkscape
20:01 pdurbin   http://wiki.greptilian.com/greptilian.com/logo.svg
20:24 codex     ok, better now? :)
20:25 codex     pdurbin: how would you specify a password for the channel?
20:25 codex     (for ilbot2)
20:26 pdurbin   much better
20:26 pdurbin   my bot doesn't use a password
20:26 pdurbin   bots
20:26 pdurbin   so please don't squat on their nicks :)
20:35 codex     no, as in I think you can join a pass. protected channel
20:36 codex     usually it's just '#channel pass' when you join
20:42 pdurbin   oh. I've never used an IRC channel that requires a password. sounds unfriendly :)
20:42 codex     heh
20:43 codex     by that effect, systems that require a password are also unfriendly :)
