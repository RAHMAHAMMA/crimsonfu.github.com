11:11 pdurbin   boegel: i just woke up to a pull request from you or something :)
11:11 * pdurbin yawns
11:24 boegel    pdurbin: yeah, just added the commands I ran on top of yours
11:24 boegel    pdurbin: didn't bother to relocate the gzip.eb though
11:41 pdurbin   ok. will have to look later. just created this (not a permanent url): http://git.greptilian.com/?p=dvn-5-vagrant.git
11:41 pdurbin   need shave, shower, breakfast for kids. will look at your pull request later :)
11:42 pdurbin   again you can always start fresh under the easybuild org if you want :)
14:59 pdurbin   so, today's my last day. looks like someone removed me from here, which saves me the trouble: http://rc.fas.harvard.edu/about-rc/research-computing-staff/
15:00 pdurbin   i'd like to mention again that if anyone out there is interested in open source virtualization and openstack, you should certainly apply for the job i'm vacating: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-11-26#i_6186072
15:03 pdurbin   and speaking of job opportunities in my old department, another job was just posted. this one is higher up the chain, higher pay grade... Manager of Research Computing IT Operations - https://twitter.com/jamesdotcuff/status/277062038407233536
15:05 dotplus   pdurbin: exciting. where are you going next?
15:05 pdurbin   dotplus: well, i made a website for myself at my new department. i think it does a pretty good job at explaining: http://people.iq.harvard.edu/~pdurbin
15:06 pdurbin   i'm going to be a software developer for The Dataverse Network Project. "a web application for sharing, citing, analyzing, and preserving research data" - http://thedata.org
15:07 pdurbin   agoddard: you had sent me some links for similar projects. we should capture them here
15:08 pdurbin   i think this was one: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fedora_Commons
15:10 pdurbin   yeah. and this was the other - "DSpace open source software is a turnkey institutional repository application" - http://www.dspace.org
15:10 pdurbin   we call our project #dvn for short. i just started a channel here on freenode for it. will have logging set up next week
15:13 dotplus   sounds interesting. I'm sorta missing the .edu world at the moment.
