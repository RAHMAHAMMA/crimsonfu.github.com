14:21 skay      pdurbin: I learned about ksplice recently becuase we use it at work to apply security patches. but I notice it's owned by Oracle now. Is there something less evil?

20:16 melodie   pdurbin in France there are a handful of places having for name "FrenchTech". not all using free open source, while I like some of what they do, I don't want them to stay in the "frenchy-french-only" circle. So we (2 of my buddies and myself) opened an new irc chan, #FrenchTech. The topic is : "Topic set by melodie - Que la FrenchTech rencontre la WorldTech :: Let the FrenchTech meet the WorldTech :: Visitez aussi #linuxvillage"
20:17 melodie   therefore I invite you as well as all the eminent coders and sys admins here, to come and stick at #FrenchTech, where I'll soon invite people from the original FrenchTech communities :)
20:22 pdurbin   cool
