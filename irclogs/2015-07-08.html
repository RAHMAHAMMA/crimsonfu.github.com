15:19 SunyataZero_ Wordpress, Drupal 8, Joomla (I've read that Drupal 8 has improvements in these areas so if going with Drupal it would be 8 and not 7)
15:19 SunyataZero_ Grateful for any help!

15:46 pdurbin      hydrajump: cool
15:46 hydrajump    I saw your solution after I was done so I didn't get a chance to test it

15:59 pdurbin      SunyataZero_: looks great
15:59 bene         for i in * ; do if [ -d "$i" ] && ! $(echo "$i" | egrep -q 'notA|notB|notC') ; then mv -v $i ../ ; fi ; done
15:59 bene         or something similar if you want to do it all in one command
