02:16 pdurbin      "I have a neckbearded Perl sysadmin friend who quite likes Scala, but wishes it could do one-liners better." -- http://www.evanchooly.com/logs/%23%23java/2013-07-16
03:04 semiosis     i wanted to like scala, but i just cant justify it.  java has incredible IDE support, and there's plenty of other languages on the JVM that I'd rather use than scala
03:05 semiosis     but i didnt take it too far
12:18 dotplus      "can't justify [scala]"? as in can't see a reason to use it over one of the alternatives on the JVM?
12:28 pdurbin      probably
12:30 pdurbin      speaking of languages, I'm listening to http://theshipshow.com/2012/12/languages-du-jour/ right now. Mostly they're comparing Python, Ruby, Perl, and shell... a bit about PowerShell and Groovy
12:31 dotplus      I asked $newjob for a safari subscription, so I now have more learning material than I know what to do with:)
12:32 pdurbin      yeah, I have that. Now I just need more time for reading
12:33 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky twilight zone time enough at last
12:33 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Enough_at_Last
12:41 * dotplus    cries a little
12:42 pdurbin      heh
12:43 pdurbin      dotplus: be careful what you ask for ;)
12:45 dotplus      why is it that so many of the Greatest Works of Art are tragic? If I had time (see what I did there?), I could point to many exmaples in Fine Art, literature, music (of most genres), drama, film, poetry and so on.
12:45 dotplus      Ballet and Opera being the canonical examples where it's virtually all tragedy
12:46 pdurbin      comedians say tragedy is easier than comedy
12:48 dotplus      tragedy/comedy is a false dichotomy, at least in the modern sense of comedy (I believe that it was a literal, tautological dichotomy in more old-fashioned usage)
12:49 dotplus      I mean where's all the happy/uplifting/positive Great Art? yes, there is some... but it's massively outweighed by all the miserable, depressing stuff (at least amongst the greatest works)
12:49 dotplus      hm, just thought. Is architecture the exception?
12:53 dotplus      anyway, enough waffling. must beat on @security to find out why `pip install foo` gives me 'no route to host' when my browser can access pypi.python.org
12:53 * pdurbin    doesn't know a lot about pip
12:55 mhayden      dotplus: can you ping/curl pypi.python.org from your server?
12:55 dotplus      it's not a pip thing. pip uses urlopen. This is a proxy issue of some kind
12:55 pdurbin      I'm using easy_install at https://github.com/dvn/swordpoc and it works fine. Running it now actually...
12:55 * mhayden    blames PRISM :)
12:56 pdurbin      lol
12:56 dotplus      I'm not in *that* part of .gov, don't glare at me
12:57 pdurbin      mhayden: you've probably seen this: Philip Durbin - Google+ - Brilliant NSA Pixar video via… - https://plus.google.com/107770072576338242009/posts/bjtaB6jN2yD
12:57 mhayden      oh yeah, that's a winner
12:57 mhayden      i was flooded with customer questions after the prism stuff leaked :/
12:57 mhayden      and someone bought a small crystal prism and left it on my desk... wonderful
12:58 dotplus      easy_install might be an option. that takes an egg and can be given an installation destination, right?
12:58 pdurbin      dotplus: it's all pythonic magic to me
12:59 pdurbin      the SWORDv2 reference implementation is in Python... I need to study it some more
15:21 pdurbin      added two step deposit example · c20de88 · dvn/swordpoc - https://github.com/dvn/swordpoc/commit/c20de88
15:39 * pdurbin    posts a looooong message: [sword-app-tech] POST atom entry, then PUT media resource - http://www.mail-archive.com/sword-app-tech@lists.sourceforge.net/msg00331.html
17:24 larsks       Technology names are getting really annoying.  If I see another "Unleash the power of Hadoop with Cloudera and Platfora" in my inbox my head is going to explode.
17:31 pdurbin      heh
18:24 JoeJulian    mhayden: Are you coming to OSCON?
18:36 mhayden      JoeJulian: unfortunately not
18:41 JoeJulian    Darn...
18:41 JoeJulian    Completely missed you all over summit.
19:27 pdurbin      JoeJulian: he should have come to dinner with us and semiosis
19:27 semiosis     i invited him
19:28 semiosis     would've been fun -- spurs vs. heat
19:28 semiosis     esp for him since the spurs dominated iirc
19:34 JoeJulian    Only "if"? You've been working on purging that memory? ;)
19:35 semiosis     i started working on purging that memory that night
19:35 semiosis     not enough beer apparently
