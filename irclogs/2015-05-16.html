14:54 hydrajump Does anyone know if it is possible to embed some code from a github repo in a blog? I'm considering starting my own blog and just doing some research and all I can find is embedding code from a gist but not from an actual repo.
15:19 pdurbin   technically, as gist is backed by a git repo
15:19 pdurbin   a* gist
15:31 pdurbin   but I don't think you can create directories within a gist
15:32 pdurbin   hydrajump: you *should* start a blog :)
18:30 hydrajump pdurbin: hehe I'll share a link when I'm ready ;)
