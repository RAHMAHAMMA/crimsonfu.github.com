16:50 pdurbin   bah! this works fine on puppet 2.7 but not 3.1: https://github.com/dvn/dvn-netbeans/blob/master/manifests/init.pp
17:40 sjoeboo   oh yikes. runstages have long been something puppetlabs said was  a bad idea to use.

17:41 pdurbin   yeah. maybe I should stop using puppet :)
17:41 pdurbin   actually, it does seem to work on 3.1. sorry for the noise
