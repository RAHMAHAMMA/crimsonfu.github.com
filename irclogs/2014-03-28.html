14:09 Pax          Morning!
14:51 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: morning!
15:18 pdurbin      overheard: "restless mouse syndrome"
15:27 codex        pdurbin: very cool
15:27 codex        morning
15:27 codex        :)
15:28 codex        pdurbin: i truly think docker is simply the next level of virtualization. What Xen and VMWware did (and now KVM is doing) for the "server" virtualization world, docker is picking right up and moving into the next phase
15:28 pdurbin      yeah
15:28 codex        docker basically defines dev-ops -- you create a generic version of an item as a completely scriptable module, and then kick off any number of configurations - from simple to complicated
15:30 pdurbin      codex: how is docker different or better than vagrant?
15:31 codex        pdurbin: it's really the server version of vagrant
15:31 codex        and it's much lighter
15:32 codex        docker recently re-wrote a major lib which removes any dependency on LXC
15:32 codex        but yea,the key things are super super light (size and install) and super fast (VMs start in < 2 seconds)
15:32 codex        pdurbin: https://www.scriptrock.com/articles/docker-vs-vagrant/
15:33 codex        scroll to the bottom to the comparison
15:33 pdurbin      in a bit. in a meeting
15:33 codex        ok
15:34 codex        the thing that really attracted me to it is the ease of commands. It is made up of 10 commands which encapsulate the entire interaction (script wise) with building any server
15:34 codex        and they are flexible enough that you never feel like you are being limited. But at the same time, you are not learning 50+ commands
15:34 codex        also, the simplicity and elegance is just beautiful
16:10 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: are you convinced? you like vagrant :)
16:37 semiosis     i wonder if i could migrate our test environment to docker
16:38 semiosis     would be nice to have jenkins just spawn a couple containers locally & not have two separate VMs running all the time
16:38 semiosis     i suppose this is similar to travis-ci
16:44 PaxIndustria pdurbin: I do like vagrant :)
16:44 pdurbin      me too
16:45 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: don't I owe you a pull request or something?
16:46 PaxIndustria oh yeah! into https://github.com/huit/vagrant-generic
16:46 PaxIndustria We've been creating branches for different models of app's
16:48 pdurbin      ah ha. https://github.com/huit/vagrant-generic/tree/splunk and https://github.com/huit/vagrant-generic/tree/theforeman and https://github.com/huit/vagrant-generic/tree/hubot ... stuff I've heard of :)
16:48 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: will these branches ever get merged into master?
16:49 PaxIndustria nope, changes from master might make it out to the branches sometimes, for example we stitched from r10k to Librarian
16:49 PaxIndustria the idea to keep from having a whole ton of vagrant-<type> repo's
16:49 pdurbin      huh. seems odd... persistent branches like that...
16:50 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: do any other projects do this? is it modeled off something?
16:50 PaxIndustria I *think* I took the idea from the openstack packstack repo
16:50 PaxIndustria https://github.com/stackforge/packstack
16:51 * pdurbin    looks at https://github.com/stackforge/packstack/branches ... essex, folsom, grizzly. hmm
16:51 PaxIndustria I won't venture to much of an opinion on if it's the *right* way to do it, but it seems to be working so far :)
16:52 pdurbin      essex is 991 commits behind master
16:52 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: do it the openshift way instead. repo per project
16:53 pdurbin      i.e. https://github.com/openshift/django-example
16:53 PaxIndustria yeah, we talked about that, it just seemed like a *lot* of repos
16:53 PaxIndustria In addition, we wanted to try and keep things like the puppet file, bootstrap.sh, and a bunch of the starting files the same, without having to manage them across a bunch of repos
16:54 pdurbin      git submodules then
16:54 semiosis     forks
16:55 PaxIndustria ug submodules *shudder*
16:55 semiosis     we have a similar model at work, we clone a master template project in gitlab, and can merge changes from the template into the forks using multiple remotes
16:55 PaxIndustria I like the forks idea though
16:55 PaxIndustria throw it up as an issue on the repo!
16:56 PaxIndustria if people like the forks idea, I'd be happy to do it!
16:59 PaxIndustria pdurbin: would love your input on this guy too! https://github.com/huit/puppet-harvard
17:01 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: sjoeboo is your puppet guy. I'm a wannabe
17:02 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: I did comment on your excellent travis work here: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2014-03-24#i_8487043 (different repo)
17:03 PaxIndustria sweet!
17:03 PaxIndustria I've been trying to use travis for all my modules
17:04 pdurbin      semiosis is getting me up to speed
17:04 PaxIndustria we used it for nepho too
17:04 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky huit nepho

17:05 pdurbin      A deployment tool for virtual data centers.
17:44 hydrajump    I have experience using VMware vSphere ESXi and Fusion, but never used vagrant and docker. I'm curious if and how docker might replace say Fusion for local VMs and how docker might be used on EC2.
17:46 codex        pdurbin: vagrant is really VM based
17:46 hydrajump    Vagrant is essentially a CLI only option (I know GUI is possible) to spin up VMs and you can use Virtualbox or Fusion. Docker on the other hand I haven't quite figured out.
17:46 codex        PaxIndustria: ^
17:46 codex        docker is truly JUST the process you need
17:46 codex        but the power is the speed/ease
17:47 hydrajump    codex are you a docker dev or just use it a lot?
17:47 codex        and the fact that it's not just a dev env., but it goes one step further - you can take it and drop it into production (same template)
17:47 codex        hydrajump: i use it like crazy
17:47 codex        i am currently managing > 5000 nodes using docker
17:47 codex        and nothing else seems to come even close to it
17:48 codex        been using it for about an year, and in the last 4-5 months it has become superb
17:48 codex        it's not "production ready yet", but most companies are already building out full infrastructure around it
17:48 hydrajump    cool so ignorant question, but if we take my typical use of VMware ESXi/ Fusion and let's say I spin up an Ubuntu Server 12.04 VM, then install postfix, dovecot creating an email server. How would this translate to using docker if at all?
17:49 codex        hydrajump: so the basic idea is that you ignore the OS layer - you focus on the apps
17:50 hydrajump    so postfix, dovecot etc would be installed in a docker container?
17:50 codex        so, you would create a "mail" container - and because each container is lightweight, you would potentially break up the postfix one and the imap one
17:50 hydrajump    ok
17:50 codex        the OS would be ~250MB -- the bare minimum needed to abstract the hypervisor info
17:50 codex        so you would do "docker -it ubuntu /bin/bash"
17:50 codex        install the software, commit your changes -- now you have an image you can push out
17:50 codex        OR
17:51 hydrajump    but what is the OS? where would my two docker containers be deployed/ installed?
17:51 codex        alternatively, use a "Dockerfile" (10 commands) and do a functional stepthrough
17:51 codex        hydrajump: any OS you want, but think of it as a hybird layer - where you have one image and deploy only diffs on top of it
17:51 codex        so if you spin up 100 mail servers, they are only using the deltas between them
17:52 hydrajump    ok so I still need to maintain the OS, configure it for security etc then add my docker containers.
17:52 codex        no
17:52 codex        b/c there is no OS in reality
17:52 codex        nothing is exposed
17:53 codex        you are literally injecting (done by docker) the bare minimum to "run" that os (some proc & dev, bare minimum binaries, etc..)
17:53 codex        at that point, you can TREAT it like a full os and run yum/apt-get and install other software
17:53 codex        but you would end up exposing only 1 app per container, so there is nothing to secure
17:53 codex        the idea is most containers don't even need ssh
17:54 codex        hydrajump: look at this: http://docs.docker.io/en/latest/examples/running_ssh_service/
17:54 hydrajump    and would AWS EC2 be a viable deployment option or as the OS is stripped down inside a docker container you deploy containers some other way?
17:54 codex        that's you setting up a container running SSHD
17:54 * hydrajump  looking
17:55 codex        hydrajump: that's one of the beaitufil things - you can use any physical or virtual environment (xen, kvm, hyper-v, vmware) or install in any already existing VM (on top of any virtual env)
17:55 codex        it behaves just the same
17:55 codex        so the image you develop on your mak (dev side), then gets takes as is (Dockerfile) and put into production -- a mesh spanning between aws, rackspace, digitalcloud, etc..
17:59 hydrajump    so can you boot a physical laptop from just a docker container?
17:59 codex        no
17:59 codex        you always need the docker layer acting between the base os /kernel
17:59 codex        again - it's not so much for desktop/user use
18:00 codex        it's really meant for servers and developers being able to run it on mac/linux, write their software/test, and then drop tested stuff into production
18:01 hydrajump    ah so a docker container by itself doesn't do anything. So can you on a Mac without Fusion/ Virtualbox/ Parallels "boot" a docker container?
18:01 codex        hydrajump: think of the container as a puppet template in a way
18:01 codex        it's the instructions of what to do
18:02 codex        you use docker itself to "launch" the template as a container
18:02 semiosis     i think of it as a chroot
18:02 codex        it it a bit
18:02 codex        chroot on steroids + all the new kernel stuff (cgroups, namespaces, etc...)
18:02 hydrajump    I don't mean as before booting the Mac itself, but if I'm booted up into say Mavericks, can I start a docker container and have my "mail" server running for testing?
18:03 codex        yea
18:03 codex        and actually there is an option where you launch it on a VM
18:03 codex        or use vagrant to deploy the "VM" env underneath -- since OS X doesn't have a native linux kernel and fusion doesn't have an API
18:03 codex        hydrajump: easiest way to test is one of two ways:
18:04 codex        1.) install latest (13.10) ubuntu and run 3 commands to install docker
18:04 codex        or
18:04 hydrajump    codex ah so on OS X I still need a hypervisor installed, but if I was using a linux OS then I wouldn't need a hypervisor?
18:04 codex        2.) install Virtualbox + Vagrant (manages "virtual layer) and then use docker directly
18:04 codex        hydrajump: correct - you need the linux kernel in some way
18:04 codex        in #2 - vagrant deploys a tiny (300MB) linux image
18:05 hydrajump    codex you develop on Mac?
18:05 codex        on yes, for no
18:05 codex        but i automatically ssh everywhere
18:05 codex        hydrajump: check this out: http://tmp.vpetkov.net/Dockerfile
18:05 codex        so think of that as "procedural"
18:06 codex        if you download that file in a folder and say "docker build -rm=true -t hydrajump/mysql ."
18:06 codex        it will take that docker file and build you a "hydrajump/mysql" image
18:06 codex        from there "docker run -it hydrajump/mysql /bin/bash" --> gets you the mysql server (a bash shell into it) in < 2 seconds
18:07 codex        so the build builds  a binary image out of the procedural - which you can then deploy
18:07 hydrajump    and from that docker file that container relies on CentOS
18:07 codex        yep
18:07 codex        FROM is what you are abstracting from
18:08 codex        you can do from an official image (Ubuntu, CentOS, etc..) or build your own
18:08 hydrajump    so it has to be deployed on that base CentOS to work
18:08 codex        but remember, base CentOS is the minimum one (<200MB)
18:08 codex        or base Ubuntu is <200MB, the base Centos is a bit bigger
18:08 codex        but yea, it's the truly BARE minimum (much smaller than no base in RHEL)
18:09 codex        so when you type "docker images" you can see yoru "built images"
18:09 codex        and you can either run interactively or as a daemon (-it vs -d)
18:09 hydrajump    so it's the docker file mysql/ centos in this case which is <200mb with any data in the database
18:09 hydrajump    *without
18:09 codex        correct
18:09 codex        and if you shut down the container, you lose the data
18:09 codex        it's run time
18:10 codex        if you want it permanent, you specify a flag
18:10 hydrajump    is this a little like VMware ThinApp if you're familiar with that?
18:10 codex        so for development, this becomes excellent, b/c if you need a "clean system"
18:10 codex        docker run -it centos /bin/bash     = new OS
18:11 codex        mm, sort of in a way
18:11 hydrajump    how do you deploy your >5000 docker containers at work? Is it internally or cloud, e.g. AWS?
18:12 codex        hydrajump: it's for a contract I was working on - it was for a wordpress/drupal provider
18:13 codex        i built data abstraction images, mysql clusters, and apache "wordpress" nodes, and then a gre+ipsec mesh underneath
18:13 codex        now when they get a new customer, it takes them <5 seconds in total to provision a complete cluster for that customer
18:13 codex        i did a tally up yesterday of the running containers, and it's 4,997 right now with 100% uptime
18:14 codex        when one cloud provider raises their prices (or another lowers them), they bring up a new VM in another provider, join the mesh, and start the containers
18:14 hydrajump    interesting...and if you deploy say 2 containers on the same host, then you need to specify that each container can talk to the other one or by default they are isolated?
18:14 codex        you can do either or
18:14 codex        by default, all containers (when you say network) get put into a "docker0" bridge
18:15 hydrajump    which is shared with the host OS?
18:15 codex        but there are crazy things you can do on top - like disable that network, and use an internal protocol that links the containers, or disable all networking and use "pipework" to join them into open vswitch
18:15 hydrajump    shit sounds crazy
18:16 codex        http://www.slideshare.net/adrienblind/docker-networking-basics-using-software-defined-networks
18:16 codex        look at slides #21 and #24
18:16 codex        that shows a pretty good example of what we are doing
18:16 codex        (where each Host # in the picture is a VM in someone's cloud)
18:17 codex        this is why I keep saying this is the future of virtualization. It's the first technology that lets you TRULY abstract over all cloud providers (that combained w/ Open vSwitch)
18:17 codex        and the fact that you can run it on top of VMs with a 0% hit is the key part
18:17 codex        b/c of the linux kernel abstractions that cgroups and namespaces provide
18:23 hydrajump    so before you worked with docker, were you working with VMware ESXi? From what you've told me it seems that a lot of knowledge of how virtualisation works with ESXi isn't applicable to how you should think about it with docker or am I wrong?
18:23 codex        hydrajump: i worked at vmware :)
18:23 codex        before that with Xen
18:24 hydrajump    hehe ok
18:24 codex        after vmware moved exclusively to KVM (which for full VM virtualization i still believe in as the best solution)
18:24 codex        along the years looked at container stuff (bsdjails, solaris zones, docker an year ago), but nothing was there yet
18:24 codex        until the linux kernel includes some key components that made it all possible
18:27 hydrajump    but as you can't have docker without full virtualisation (if we neglect physical) then you still need to have a working knowledge of let's say ESXi and then docker assuming you were the only one responsible for the full stack.
18:27 hydrajump    at first I thought docker was completely standalone
18:28 hydrajump    but you've explained that that is not the case ;)
18:29 hydrajump    or AWS EC2 and docker..
18:42 PaxIndustria just got back, and skimmed over the thread, codex: docker still seems a bit like "magic chroot box" to me
18:42 PaxIndustria gotta run out again in about 10, but I'll hit you up for beer at some point to get both barrels from ya :)
18:43 hydrajump    codex I read the vagrant/ docker comparison and I have a better understanding of docker thanks to you! I actually have a project coming up that involves setting up a mail server and I was going to just use ansible to configure an EC2 instance, but I should maybe reconsider and look at using docker.
18:44 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: can I come? :)
18:44 hydrajump    Thanks for the docker intro codex!
18:44 PaxIndustria pdurbin: So long as your buying ;)
18:45 pdurbin      !
18:45 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: come to an IQSS pub night next Friday at Queenshead
18:45 pdurbin      hell, you all can come
18:45 PaxIndustria LOL I might, next friday is my last day, so I think a bunch of us are going out for a beer :)
18:46 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: last day?!? ;)
18:46 * pdurbin    knows what he means :)
18:47 ben_e        what does he mean?
18:47 ben_e        the twitter/irc/abcd fuzzy connections thing means i sorta know who people are but not really
18:48 ben_e        agoddard likes pie though
18:49 PaxIndustria I'm taking a job with FAS RC and my last day at my current gig is next friday :)
18:55 ben_e        where are you leaving?
18:55 ben_e        ISTR jcuff tweeting about "getting you" :-)
18:56 PaxIndustria LOL
18:56 PaxIndustria I'm leaving the HUIT Network group
18:58 PaxIndustria gg ttyl!
19:05 codex        hydrajump: np. good luck
23:28 pdurbin      wow. so much docker fu
23:33 hydrajump    pdurbin you played with docker?
