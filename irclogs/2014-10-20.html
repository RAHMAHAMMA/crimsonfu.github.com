10:41 pdurbin   hydrajump: I'm hearing good things about influxdb: http://irclogs.shortcircuit.net.au/%23circuits/2014-10-20.log.html
10:42 pdurbin   "it's actually a replacement for nagios"
10:55 hydrajump pdurbin: hi I don't know if "replacement for nagios" is an accurate description but yeah influxdb is something I will be testing soon.
11:13 pdurbin   looks like you mentioned it vs. sensu here: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2014-09-11#i_9338149
11:28 hydrajump right so "grafana+riemann+influxdb+statsd" vs nagios not influxdb vs nagios ;)
11:29 hydrajump influxdb as far as I know is a metrics database. It won't do alerting and all that other stuff with additional tools such as those I mentioned.
11:29 hydrajump *without*
11:32 pdurbin   ah, ok
15:25 semiosis  kubuntu \o/
15:52 pdurbin   heh. well, I'm trying vanilla ubuntu. I removed the amazon button from the dock
17:23 semiosis  pdurbin: seriously, kde is the best desktop interface.  so far advanced.  totally worth your time to check it out
17:37 pdurbin   my buddy who uses netbsd is really into kde
18:43 larsks    ...but he's using netbsd, so his judgement is already suspect.
18:58 pdurbin   heh
19:05 semiosis  best thing netbsd ever did was kick out Theo so we could have openbsd
