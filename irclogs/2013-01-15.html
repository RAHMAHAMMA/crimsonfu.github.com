09:45 jgtimmer pdurbin: if you use git mv instead of a regular move it will know for sure
09:45 jgtimmer git rm, git add in the same commit will also work most of the time
11:14 pdurbin  jgtimmer: i definitely agree with you about the same commit thing
11:15 pdurbin  in practice i never really use `git mv`. just `mv` and `git add . &amp;&amp; git commit .` works well for me usually
11:15 pdurbin  but i'll pass this along. thanks!
