02:28 semiosis   tidesdk is not going well for me :(
02:28 semiosis   apparently it needs to be built, but that's non-trivial on ubuntu
02:40 pdurbin    is it trivial on mac and windows?
02:42 semiosis   isn't everything?
02:42 semiosis   i dont know
02:53 pdurbin    it's a decent idea anyway. web technologies as a native app
02:54 pdurbin    semiosis: can you do the whole thing in javascript and embed it all on a single html page you give to people?
02:55 semiosis   doubtful, i need to recursively scan a directory
02:57 semiosis   afaik the only way to read a file is with the file input element
02:57 semiosis   that's not powerful enough
02:57 semiosis   starting to play with javafx now
03:01 pdurbin    huh. lemme know how it goes
03:02 semiosis   sure thing
13:56 semiosis   pdurbin: javafx rocks!
13:56 pdurbin    heh
13:57 semiosis   http://www.zenjava.com/2012/11/24/from-zero-to-javafx-in-5-minutes/
13:58 semiosis   because maven, of course
13:59 semiosis   i'm pleased to see that javafx abandoned its scripting language, that thing sucked
13:59 semiosis   now it's just a declarative UI language (in XML of course) combined with java code
14:00 semiosis   and conventions make it super easy, for example: add a UI element to the XML file and set an id attribute on it.  then you can bind that to your java code by making an instance variable with the same name as the id and annotating it with @FXML
14:01 semiosis   so you dont have to write binding code
14:01 semiosis   or event handlers, etc
14:02 semiosis   actions/events work similarly... make a method in your controller class, then give the UI element an onAction attribute with the name of the method
14:02 semiosis   it just works
14:02 semiosis   anyway, gotta run, bbl
14:03 pdurbin    at first I read that as @FML
14:11 pdurbin    with java everything is xml
14:20 * pdurbin  claws his eyes out
15:19 agoddard   ben_e: heyooo
15:20 agoddard   yeah we want to swap it out at some point for ceph or swift, but we have a very specific use case for the data -we basically want to serve a few million files over HTTP (and only over http)
15:21 agoddard   we're doing a metrics hack day today which I'm running so gonna be afk a bunch
15:26 pdurbin    agoddard: what was this crazy tweet of yours?
15:30 agoddard   pdurbin: about gluster?
15:30 pdurbin    yeah
15:35 semiosis   pdurbin: now that you're using an IDE it's time to embrace XML
15:35 pdurbin    semiosis: I go back and forth between formatting my XML in netbeans and vim. I should probably pick a command line tool
15:36 * agoddard searches tweets, has a bad memory
15:36 pdurbin    lol
15:36 semiosis   pdurbin: xmllint
15:36 agoddard   probably that I wanted to swap to swap gluster when it wasn't behaving, but I ended up upgrading it all and it's been rock solid
15:37 pdurbin    semiosis: +1
15:38 ben_e      i can't find it either
15:38 ben_e      maybe i imagined it in a dream
15:39 pdurbin    ben_e: you need a vacation
15:39 ben_e      no shit
15:39 ben_e      :-)
