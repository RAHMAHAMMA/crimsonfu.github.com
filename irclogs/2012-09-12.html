14:23 pdurbin       not sure how it became crimsonfubot` with a `
14:25 semiosis      pdurbin: JoeJulian runs a supybot, glusterbot, in #gluster... it's pretty sweet
14:25 semiosis      pdurbin: re: the nick, consider registering it with nickserv, then giving the bot's nick chanops with chanserv
14:26 semiosis      then you can have the bot do your bidding :)
14:29 pdurbin       uh. ok. might need a howto
14:29 pdurbin       #ircnewbie
14:30 semiosis      pdurbin: chanserv &amp; nickserv are services provided by freenode.  http://freenode.net/using_the_network.shtml
14:30 semiosis      you can "/msg {chanserv,nickserv} help" too
14:31 semiosis      try, for example, /msg chanserv access list #crimsonfu
14:31 pdurbin       yes, i'm somewhat familiar: http://crimsonfu.github.com/2012/02/06/crimsonfu-freenode-irc-channel-setup.html
14:31 semiosis      thats what i thought :)
14:32 pdurbin       crimsonfubot probably deserves a blog post, maybe once i do the extra stuff you suggest
14:32 semiosis      somewhere down on my todo list is to do the same for #logstash, though i haven't mentioned it to them yet
14:33 semiosis      a bot could really help around there
14:34 pdurbin       patches welcome for crimsonfubot :)

15:36 pdurbin       ventz: hi
16:27 JoeJulian     pdurbin: You posted a link to that weather email that has a quote from Socrates. When I first glanced at it I read it as, "Being kind to everyone you meet is fighting a hard battle." :)
16:29 pdurbin       JoeJulian: ha!
17:11 larsks        .b 1
17:11 larsks        whoops...
17:47 pdurbin       larsks: should i add you to https://github.com/organizations/crimsonfu/settings/members so you can push your solution to https://github.com/crimsonfu/code/tree/master/katas/autovivification ?
17:48 larsks        Sure?
17:49 pdurbin       ( http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-09-11#i_5977652 )
17:50 pdurbin       done! you're welcome to make a page here too if you want: http://crimsonfu.github.com/members
18:02 larsks        Thanks!
18:03 pdurbin       sure :)
18:13 ventz         pdurbin: pm
18:24 pdurbin       ventz: sorry. many things in flight
18:26 ventz         np, give it a shot. should be all set
18:30 pdurbin       crimsonfubot: lucky crimsonfubot
18:30 crimsonfubot  pdurbin: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-06-09
18:30 pdurbin       that's better
18:36 pdurbin       "This Environment Module audit at Harvard was the inspiration for this article, and I want to thank the Harvard team, particularly their fearless leader and Desperate Perl guru, Dr. James Cuff" -- http://hpc.admin-magazine.com/Articles/Auditing-Environment-Modules/%28offset%29/4
19:43 pdurbin_m     An introduction to version control with Git: http://acops.seas.harvard.edu/workshops.html
19:44 pdurbin_m     (at a git talk)
19:48 pdurbin_m     huh. https://openid.seas.harvard.edu
19:49 pdurbin_m     Atlassian CrowdID... I've never really thought of being an openid provider for our users...
19:59 pdurbin_m     not that anyone has asked for it :)
20:01 pdurbin_m     https://code.seas.harvard.edu
20:08 pdurbin_m     sounds like gitorious just throws ssh keys in the git user's .ssh directory. like I'm doing manually (via puppet)
20:09 pdurbin_m     http://gitorious.org
20:09 semiosis      isn't that deprecated in favor of gitolite?
20:10 semiosis      hmm seems like i'm thinking of something else
20:11 semiosis      ah, was thinking of gitosis, nm
20:11 semiosis      i just set up gitlab yesterday, beginning to play with it today... do you have any opinion on gitorious vs. gitlab?
20:32 pdurbin_m     https://code.seas.harvard.edu/gitorious_installation/gitorious_installation_repo/blobs/master/Gitorious_Install_Centos6.sh
20:32 pdurbin_m     much work went into that script apparently
20:35 larsks        Gitorious does not use user home directories.
20:35 larsks        "gitosis" is what people used before gitloite.
20:35 larsks        Gitorious is more like github...but not quite as slick.
20:36 larsks        It's substantially nicer than either gitosis or gitolite because it offers a complete self-service solution.  We're trying to take ourselves out of the critical path of people getting things done.
20:37 larsks        We've rolled out openid because (a) lots of web applications use it "out of the box", and Harvard doesn't yet have a good federated authentication solution.  Our OpenID providers lets you use *either* FAS or SEAS credentials.
20:37 larsks        It's more "aggragation" than "federation", but we really, really needed to be able to offer a service across both authentication domains.
20:38 pdurbin_m     lars: a common "git" user's home dir, right?
20:38 larsks        I've never used gitlab...
20:39 larsks        It does manage a common "git" user's home directory, and then uses a wrapper script to control access-via-ssh in the same way it handles access-via-http. There's lots of repository metadata (collaborats and permissions and so forth) that are stored in a database.
20:41 pdurbin_m     ok. thanks
20:41 pdurbin_m     that's what I'm hearing
20:42 pdurbin_m     at $work we use straight git, not unlike my own http://git.greptilian.com
20:45 larsks        We've moved all our own stuff onto code.seas -- both because (a) we want to eat our own dogfood, and (b) because it turns out to be a lot easier than managing straight git when there are a bunch of people involved.
20:45 larsks        We have a few things hosted on github because of the automatic-web-content-from-your-repository (e.g., acops.seas.harvard.edu is a git repository hosted on github), but not much else.
20:46 larsks        https://github.com/seasac-ops/seasac-ops.github.com
20:46 pdurbin_m     overheard: "they're gonna want buttons" :)
20:47 larsks        From my perspective, the big Missing Feature in Gitorious is the lack of UI support for web hooks (e.g., like https://help.github.com/articles/post-receive-hooks).  There's support in the code, but you need backend access to set things up.
20:48 pdurbin_m     Hmm. Ok
