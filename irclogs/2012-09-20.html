12:56 pdurbin      semiosis: this app of yours is getting interesting :) https://twitter.com/pragmaticism/status/248638786806902784
13:42 pdurbin      duh. `yum install libguestfs-winsupport` is the fix for "virt-v2v: No root device found in this operating system image.` per http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-05-24#i_5632538

14:27 pdurbin      bummer... "not easily at the moment" [cobbler] Windows Installation through PXE - https://lists.fedorahosted.org/pipermail/cobbler/2012-September/008224.html
14:57 dotplus      ironcamel: pdurbin suggested you might have input on this: I have nginx proxying to an appserver with upstream foo { server unix:/var/run/foo.sock; }, and we're occasionally seeing 502 bad gateway errors. If the appserver is not broken (i.e. a new request is handled just fine), does it suggest that I need more appserver workers? appserver is starman
15:04 ironcamel    dotplus: i would do a simple test, just slam your app with parallel http requests until you get 502s. then up the # of starman workers and see if it helps
15:09 dotplus      sounds reasonable, I'll try that. thanks.
