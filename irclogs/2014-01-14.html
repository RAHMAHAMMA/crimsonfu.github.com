15:36 pdurbin      nope. is it good?
15:56 joshu        pdurbin just reading about it now, so I haven't used it yet. Interested as the instances are stored in an Icelandic datacenter..the green stuff is nice too. Don't know how muture their IaaS is though
16:20 pdurbin      somewhat related... I just listened to a podcast about Flynn - The product that ops provides to developers - https://flynn.io/
16:20 pdurbin      5by5 | The Changelog #115: Flynn updates with Jonathan Rudenberg and Jeff Lindsay - http://5by5.tv/changelog/115
16:23 pdurbin      it's more of a PaaS though... open source heroku, kinda
19:58 melodie      hello!
19:58 melodie      pdurbin ?
21:16 semiosis     i'm looking forward to watching this tonight... https://plus.google.com/events/cedmlfrcb20jm3d2cb6s283cjsk - AngularJS & D3: Directives for Visualizations
21:27 pdurbin      hmm
21:28 pdurbin      I'm thinking of playing with this: Spyglass provides a simple search interface for Solr using EmberJS https://github.com/o19s/spyglass
21:28 pdurbin      melodie: I'm here but I gotta run
21:31 melodie      pdurbin could you ping me another time when you won't need to run?
21:31 melodie      I'd need to explain what brings me, during about 10 to 15 minutes max :)
23:17 pdurbin      melodie: go
23:17 pdurbin      :)
23:17 melodie      he ! :D
23:18 melodie      I think you remember the article about seeds I put up, well I submitted it to RMS. First time he said it has to be all in English, so be it, I put it all in English, then I put some English persons on it for proofreading.
23:19 pdurbin      melodie: the gnu birthday one?
23:19 melodie      just lately I sent a mail to him again to ask if this time he would be ok to point to it on his personal activist website, and he reviewed it partly, so he told me it is not good, and he gave me the reasons.
23:19 melodie      no
23:19 melodie      not gnu birthday
23:19 melodie      not about free software, about seeds
23:19 melodie      http://melodie.citrotux.org/2013/11/19/the-programmed-end-of-the-free-seeds/
23:20 melodie      this is what he told me (I'm going to put it on a pastebin):
23:20 pdurbin      oh, the seen done. like you said :)
23:20 pdurbin      seed*
23:20 melodie      http://pastebin.fr/32289
23:20 melodie      this is what he told me.
23:21 melodie      I thought I would ask your help, because you know so many people who might be able to help, make the message clear as source water.
23:21 pdurbin      "The programmed end of the freedom-respecting seeds"
23:21 pdurbin      yeah, that sounds like RMS :)
23:23 melodie      I could even rewrite it "the programmed end of the democra-seed"
23:23 melodie      :)
23:23 pdurbin      "I found four problems in the first four lines of text.  The text needs to be thoroughly edited by someone who writes publication-quality English.  The article is long, so I can't do that job for you."
23:23 melodie      but in English it might not make much sense
23:24 melodie      I think if someone can help me with that, and if someone as RMS requesting such a high level of quality gets it, the article could make it's way in many places
23:25 melodie      and I would like to gather more testimonials from places in the world where more people have to struggle for their freedom to plant and grow vegetables, the ones that are eaten and healing plants too
23:28 pdurbin      melodie: I feel like maybe some community under "Food Politics" at http://www.willystreet.coop/links-other-sites could help you
23:28 melodie      that would be very nice!
23:28 melodie      do you know any of the people from there?
23:29 melodie      which state is WI ?
23:29 pdurbin      from the city where that co-op is, yes... and they're pretty into food politics... let you what... I'll link them to this conversation at least
23:30 pdurbin      wisconsin
23:30 melodie      pdurbin great! I'd very much like to have a connection with them
23:30 pdurbin      madison is full of people who care about food politics
23:30 melodie      if you still have my mail adress feel free to give it to them
23:30 melodie      is madison the name of a town?
23:33 melodie      lately I was handed the link to a video about something which happened, that I talk about in the post : the growers who were busted on the open air market. the video is well done, by a French man who is known for his tales. He explains it as a modern tale.
23:33 melodie      if it could be subtitled in English that would be very nice
23:34 melodie      pdurbin do you know what? It is the first time that I read or heard the words put together : "food politics"
23:35 melodie      just the idea is amazing!
23:36 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky madison wi
23:36 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://www.cityofmadison.com/
23:36 pdurbin      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Food_politics
23:37 pdurbin      melodie: I emailed a few friends. I'll let you know if they reply
23:39 pdurbin      melodie: you could try asking at http://forums.seedsavers.org
23:39 pdurbin      my wife buys seeds from there (heirloom tomatoes). great place
23:39 melodie      pdurbin I will wait to see if you and I get answers from the mail you just sent, before moving forward.
23:40 melodie      there are many things to do so I won't head into several directions at a time
23:41 melodie      pdurbin if you and your wife, and children,  come visit nearbye my place, I'll provide you with such adresses and the ones to get the best freshly grown food!
23:41 pdurbin      melodie: yum :)
23:42 melodie      :)
23:45 melodie      pdurbin I would also agree on my article being used to make a new one if needed : as long as the message is passed on and the information it contains transmitted.
23:45 melodie      this is just a thought which came through my mind right now :)
23:46 pdurbin      :)
23:55 melodie      changing topic, have you see the sourceforge.net project of the month? http://sourceforge.net/projects/wurfl/
23:55 melodie      I thought you might be interested

23:56 pdurbin      mobile is getting huge
23:56 pdurbin      walmart was having trouble dealing with the load from mobile devices
23:58 pdurbin      they switched to node.js and talked all about it here: http://nodeup.com/fiftysix https://github.com/noahcollins/transcriptions/blob/56-a-team-walmart-show-nodebf/56-a-team-walmart-show-nodebf.md
