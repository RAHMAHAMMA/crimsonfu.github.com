05:37 codex   pdurbin: right - just really funny about how the whole thing was built
05:37 codex   it reminds me a bit of those developers that add something at the end of a decision block that says something like "OR 1=1" :)
05:38 codex   and it gets forgotten
10:35 pdurbin that never happens ;)

18:04 dotplus yay, got test-kitchen to create/destroy cloud instances for testing our Ansible roles with a small patch to kitchen-vagrant and some appropriate .kitchen.yml.
18:05 dotplus getting closer to fully-automated CI.
19:04 dotplus possibly this should be using kitchen-ec2 and kitchen-openstack instead of kitchen-vagrant
