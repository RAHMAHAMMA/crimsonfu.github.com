19:34 melodie hi
19:39 melodie anyone could help me with memory on kernel boot line ? I would like to limit the amount of memory taken in account by the kernel, for test purposes
19:39 melodie https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/kernel-parameters.txt
19:39 melodie starting from here:
19:40 melodie "mem=nn[KMG] [KNL,BOOT] Force usage of a specific amount of memory"
19:40 melodie there are things I don't understand
19:41 melodie my question is if I add to the kernel boot line "mem=386M", will it understand "please use 386 MB only" ?
