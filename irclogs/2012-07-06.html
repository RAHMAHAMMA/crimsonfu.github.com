13:59 pdurbin      westmaas: you've used SQLAlchemy. what do you think of these warnings from `openstack-db --init --service nova`? http://danceb.in/jM3zrnHH4RGrbzXkl9DNYg
14:22 jimi_c       If I had to bet, I'd say a table was missing from the schema
14:24 pdurbin      jimi_c: i guess. it seems to be only a warning, so i'm moving on
14:26 * jimi_c     goes back to working on cobbler documentation
14:26 pdurbin      based on the history of the Getting started with OpenStack EPEL page ( https://fedoraproject.org/w/index.php?title=Getting_started_with_OpenStack_EPEL&amp;action=history ) i guess it looks like Pádraig Brady from Red Hat ( https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/User:Pbrady ) has made some recent edits
14:27 pdurbin      i think this was tripping me up yesterday: '2/ The sudoers setup is a bit brittle because it assumes things about your /etc/sudoers ("must include /etc/sudoers.d")' -- nova_sudoers is brittle, often out of date, and too permissive https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/nova/+bug/681774
14:29 pdurbin      jimi_c: this one should be a quick fix :) Issue #1: Community page for Cobbler mailing list and IRC channels · cobbler/cobbler.github.com - https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler.github.com/issues/1
14:29 jimi_c       yeah i saw that and replied :)
14:29 jimi_c       that's a quick fix
14:30 pdurbin      yeah. was glad you agree :) i was pretty sure you guys were on freenode... would be nice to make that obvious
14:31 jimi_c       just putting the twitter link on there has helped - sadly i now have as many followers as tweets :)
14:31 jimi_c       or maybe that's a good thing
14:33 pdurbin      jimi_c: very good follow cost: http://followcost.com/cobblerista
14:34 jimi_c       never seen that before
14:35 pdurbin      #crimsonfu is good for that :)
14:53 pdurbin      2012-07-06 10:51:54 INFO nova.virt.libvirt.connection [-] [instance: 3b1f1695-7b2f-4563-aa28-f969ecc58feb] Instance spawned successfully.
14:53 pdurbin      \o/
14:53 pdurbin      the fix: echo '#includedir /etc/sudoers.d' &gt;&gt; /etc/sudoers
15:40 pdurbin      westmaas: you'd be proud of me. making noise in http://eavesdrop.openstack.org/irclogs/%23openstack/%23openstack.2012-07-06.log
15:40 pdurbin      they need clickable anchors per line in their irc logs like we've got :)
15:53 westmaas     pdurbin: nice!
15:53 westmaas     I'm glad someone is in there to be helpful :)
15:54 westmaas     well
15:54 westmaas     attempt to be helpful
15:55 pdurbin      westmaas: do you have any idea why i can't ssh to the VM?
16:11 pdurbin      cool, here's openstack on rhel guide I was using last week: Red Hat Essex Preview Lab Guide, Red Hat Summit - 2012 Edition: http://fedorapeople.org/~russellb/openstack-lab-rhsummit-2012/
16:12 pdurbin      via https://twitter.com/russellbryant/status/219836588757229568 . also taught by Derek Higgins https://twitter.com/bethehokie
16:13 pdurbin      Red Hat Quietly Joins the OpenStack Effort - http://www.readwriteweb.com/cloud/2012/01/red-hat-quietly-joins-the-open.php
16:13 pdurbin      heh, red hat is not so quiet about it now!
16:33 SEJeff       pdurbin, Have you seen this? https://github.com/aaalex/Dancer-Plugin-REST
16:33 SEJeff       just curious
16:33 SEJeff       https://github.com/sukria/Dancer-Plugin-REST This one actually
16:33 pdurbin      looks awesome
16:33 pdurbin      but i'm hoping to use tastypie with django i guess
16:34 pdurbin      since i'm the only perl guy :(
16:34 SEJeff       tastypie is good stuff
16:38 pdurbin      hmm. "When converting a Windows virtual machine from VMware ESX, ensure that VMware Tools is not installed on the virtual machine. The VMware Tools must be uninstalled prior to the conversion process. If a virtual machine is converted with the VMware Tools installed, it will not function correctly." -- V2V Guide - http://docs.redhat.com/docs/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux/6/html-single/V2V_Guide/index.html
16:39 pdurbin      but we're seeing problems using virt-v2v on a *linux* box (rhel 4) that had vmware tools installed
16:39 pdurbin      eth0 nic not recognized, etc.
16:40 pdurbin      we've migrated a lot of linux boxes over with virt-v2v and they've been fine
16:42 pdurbin      seems kinda related: Bug 787734 – virt-v2v does not remove VMware guest tools RPMs - https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=787734
16:43 pdurbin      SEJeff: i should tell you that the other day a guy on our team wrote "I have to say, it's actually pretty amazing how easy it is to migrate
16:43 pdurbin      these VM's over."
16:43 pdurbin      and i replied with "thanks to sejeff for reminding me about virt-v2v" :)
16:45 jimi_c       pdurbin: modprobe.conf issue? might have the drivers hard-coded to vmware's
16:46 SEJeff       :)
16:46 SEJeff       pdurbin, glad to help
16:46 SEJeff       Sometimes I wish there was a simple way to dump all of my experience into digital form so I could share it with other people. Perhaps put it on github and accept pull requests to learn more?
16:46 SEJeff       That would be outstanding
16:50 pdurbin      meh. that's pretty much what this channel is for :)
16:50 SEJeff       heh
16:50 SEJeff       dump /dev/brain
18:04 pdurbin      rackerhacker: do you know who is in charge of the irc logging at http://eavesdrop.openstack.org ? i don't need names. i'm just curious :)
18:11 rackerhacker IIRC it's the feller sitting next to me
18:12 pdurbin      please show him http://moritz.faui2k3.org/en/ilbot and what http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-07-06 looks like
18:22 rackerhacker haha, i can
18:39 pdurbin      westmaas: do you have an image i can import into openstack that you know the root password for?
18:40 pdurbin      derekh in #openstack thinks that maybe the root ssh key injection isn't working
19:31 jimi_c       pdurbin: Added pages for community/who's using cobbler
19:33 pdurbin      http://cobbler.github.com/community.html and http://cobbler.github.com/users.html . looks great!
19:35 jimi_c       not sure if that users page is 100% accurate anymore, i copied the data out of the old fedorahosted.org wiki page
19:35 jimi_c       hopefully no companies send me a nastygram...
19:35 pdurbin      details ;)
19:36 pdurbin      i'm able to ssh to an openstack vm now. derekh was super helpful: http://danceb.in/yraw5qDH4RGnzXkl9DNYg
19:37 pdurbin      see especially this bit standing up a tty_linux vm he posted: http://pastebin.com/hYbJTzuj
20:03 pdurbin      so as i was just telling sjoeboo... i'm glad i'm using http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Getting_started_with_OpenStack_EPEL to get openstack stood up but as /usr/bin/openstack-demo-install (from openstack-utils-2012.1-1.el6.noarch) says, that doc's purpose is to "Install and Enable all OpenStack services on a single node, for testing/demonstration purposes."
20:04 pdurbin      a lot gets done for you
20:04 pdurbin      http://fedorapeople.org/~russellb/openstack-lab-rhsummit-2012/ (the lab i went through last week) is a much better doc for helping you understand the underlying components better
20:05 pdurbin      especially set up of users, roles, and services (with keystone)
20:05 pdurbin      (whenever i hear keystone, all i can think of is keystone light)
20:06 pdurbin      "Keystone Light, introduced 1989, found with a blue label" -- http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keystone_%28beer_brand%29
20:06 pdurbin      The "Light" and "Ice" versions of the beer are far more prevalent and readily available for retail across the United States. Though Keystone Premium exists, it appears much less than its "Light" variety on liquor store shelves. "Dry" and "Amber Light" varieties were discontinued in the late 90s.
20:06 pdurbin      god bless you, wikipedia
20:07 pdurbin      i think i'm getting punchy from all this openstack nonsense
20:08 pdurbin      westmaas: i blame you
20:16 westmaas     pdurbin: keystone had an implementation which was subsequently replaced with keystone light
20:17 pdurbin      nice
20:18 pdurbin      Active Instances: 5 Active Memory: 8GB This Month's VCPU-Hours: 11.68 This Month's GB-Hours: 310.63
20:18 pdurbin      this is kinda cool
20:18 pdurbin      i guess
20:30 pdurbin      :)
20:33 rackerhacker happy friday: http://www.reddit.com/tb/w4xu2
22:17 westmaas     pdurbin: haha
