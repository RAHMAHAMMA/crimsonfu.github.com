04:32 prologic  Does anyone here know much about AWS and Public IP Addressing?
04:33 prologic  Specifically around releasing an address of an EC2 (that you had no control over); e.g: AWS reboots your instance and it's Public IP Address changes? *Does/Can* that happen? If it does; is it rate? Is it based off DHCP-like technology and DHCP leases?
11:22 pdurbin   prologic: semiosis knows AWS quite well
11:23 hydrajump prologic: IIRC if your EC2 instance has an assigned public IP (not an elastic IP which costs money) and you or AWS reboots the instance then the public IP will change.
11:23 hydrajump let me double check
11:26 hydrajump one correction. the public ip only changes when you start/stop **not** reboot!
11:27 hydrajump prologic: "A public IP address is assigned to your instance from Amazon's pool of public IP addresses, and is not associated with your AWS account. When a public IP address is disassociated from your instance, it is released back into the public IP address pool, and you cannot reuse it."
11:27 hydrajump "We release the public IP address for your instance when it's stopped or terminated. Your stopped instance receives a new public IP address when it's restarted."
11:28 hydrajump source: http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-instance-addressing.html#concepts-public-addresses
11:29 prologic  yeah
11:29 prologic  that's whay I thought
11:29 prologic  so as long as your instance is nailed up
11:29 prologic  it's public ip should not change
11:29 prologic  So basically in theory what I'm looking to do at work
11:30 prologic  is spin up an EC2 in each zone of a region
11:30 prologic  they both get a public ip
11:30 prologic  and on boot I automatically add the ips into a wildcard record set / zone with a 1m ttl
11:30 prologic  possibly with weighted routing?
12:44 hydrajump sounds like you want to use route53 for that
12:45 hydrajump as well as ELBs
12:49 prologic  well yes Route53
12:49 prologic  but I'm not sold on ELBs per se
12:49 prologic  as I plan to use my own load balancer
12:49 prologic  haproxy for example
16:27 semiosis  prologic: sounds like you want to use an autoscaling group with an ELB in front
16:27 semiosis  that will take care of everything for you
16:27 semiosis  you can set the AS group to use all the zones and it will keep instances running in there
16:37 semiosis  prologic: i'm most familiar with "ec2-classic" but now they're pushing everyone into VPC.  i believe with VPC you can control the private IP of your hosts, so you wouldn't need to do any dynamic config (of DNS, for example) for your haproxy
16:38 semiosis  another benefit of vpc is access to the latest generation of instances, which give more performance per dollar
18:20 JoeJulian I'm starting to wonder about that last statement. We seem to be having more and more resource starved users on aws in #gluster. I don't know enough about aws to know what to ask though.
20:20 semiosis  JoeJulian: can you give me a log link so i can see what you're talking about?  also feel free to ping me next time that comes up
20:51 prologic  yeah
20:52 prologic  I've found in practice that AutoScaling Groups and ELBs don't really scale all that well
20:52 prologic  they respond too slowly to load spoikes
