15:45 pdurbin    tychoish: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/search.pl?channel=crimsonfu&amp;nick=&amp;q=ikiwiki
15:45 pdurbin    i'm forever going on about ikiwiki in this channel :)
15:48 tychoish   yeah
15:48 tychoish   and in #ikiwiki too ;)
15:48 pdurbin    i can't help myself. the love is so deep
15:49 pdurbin    but come on, i haven't been in #ikiwiki in weeks. it's on that *other* irc network
15:49 tychoish   I've been using it since early 2007?  or sometime in 2006.
15:49 tychoish   this is why god made multi-network IRC clients in 1994
15:50 pdurbin    and it was good
15:52 tychoish   yep

18:45 SEJeff     tychoish, No, the news says the password hashes were leaked
18:46 pdurbin    yeah, seems like it was the hashes
18:46 tychoish   salt too?

18:54 pdurbin    "And finally, oVirt, an advanced server virtualization management system based on libvirt and KVM, is fully packaged for Fedora 17: http://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/oVirt " -- [fedora-virt] Fedora virt status May 2012 - http://lists.fedoraproject.org/pipermail/virt/2012-June/003288.html
18:54 pdurbin    somehow i missed this. that oVirt is fully packaged now
19:08 shuff      sweet!
19:08 SEJeff     pdurbin, In F17, right?
19:09 SEJeff     Oh sorry. It was one of the accepted F17 features.
19:15 tychoish   but it's still fedora
19:15 tychoish   oh right this channel is a redhat lovefest
19:37 pdurbin    hmm, could debian or ubuntu use oVirt?  i don't see why not. . . it's open source
19:44 pdurbin    and what is not to love about red hat anyway :)
