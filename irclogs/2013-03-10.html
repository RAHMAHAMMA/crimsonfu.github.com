16:45 westmaas I guess just with active development
16:45 westmaas hm
16:45 westmaas well
16:45 westmaas not terribly active
16:46 pdurbin  active enough, maybe
16:46 westmaas 1 commit in 6 months!
16:46 pdurbin  maybe etherpad is feature complete ;)
16:46 westmaas haha

16:47 westmaas I guess just the etherpad as a service
16:47 westmaas EaaS
