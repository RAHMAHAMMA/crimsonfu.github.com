15:15 pdurbin   that didn't work out so well for lavabit
15:16 bene      the swiss are much more librul
15:16 bene      xref all their hidden nazi gold
15:30 larsks    I dunno.  Seems like a lot of "trust us, we're *totally* encrypting things".  How would we ever know?
15:31 larsks    And of course, http://www.jwz.org/blog/2014/05/google-has-most-of-my-email-because-it-has-all-of-yours/
16:25 semiosis  i need to document a json/rest api.  suggestions?
16:26 semiosis  i found this... https://helloreverb.com/developers/swagger anyone know of other solutions?
16:40 hydrajump larsks: I believe they are planning to open-source the code IIRC
16:41 pdurbin   semiosis: thanks. I had forgotten what that was called. looks like I mentioned it here: http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2013-08-27#i_18523
16:44 hydrajump Here's the tweet from protonmail https://twitter.com/ProtonMail/status/468759469006942209
16:45 pdurbin   semiosis: but! should we be documenting APIs at all? should they be self describing instead?
16:45 pdurbin   "We put them all in human-written documentation that you have to write up and figure out yourself, whereas when they’re actually in the response you can know what you’re doing just by looking at the service." -- http://javascriptjabber.com/104-jsj-hypermedia-apis-with-steve-klabnik/
16:46 semiosis  pdurbin: if only it were that simple
16:46 pdurbin   heh. exactly
16:47 pdurbin   swagger looks nice
16:47 * pdurbin sends an email to the team about swagger
23:19 semiosis  not thrilled with swagger's handling of multipart form (file) upload endpoints
23:21 pdurbin   bummer
23:35 semiosis  http://imgur.com/70um7i3 for example
23:36 semiosis  the two "body" lines are really one form param called "file" but swagger refuses to use the right field name
23:37 semiosis  also no obvious way to say what content types are allowed/supported for the file
