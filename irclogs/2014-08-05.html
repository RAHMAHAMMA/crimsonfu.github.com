11:48 pdurbin   hmm, when I try to curl http://www.smartpeoplepodcast.com/?feed=podcast
11:49 pdurbin   I don't get the XML I expect... instead I get a bunch of javascript that apparently has the URL encoded in it. It works in the browser (I see the XML) but I can't figure out how to have curl download the XML.
11:57 bencomp   Accept: text/html ?
11:57 bencomp   xml
11:59 pdurbin   bencomp: wow, that totally works. thanks!
11:59 pdurbin   curl -H "Accept: text/xml" http://www.smartpeoplepodcast.com/?feed=podcast
