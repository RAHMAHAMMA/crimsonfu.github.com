01:26 ben_e        http://northeastlinuxfest.org/?page_id=161 <- speaker list has "Aditya Patawari Building Orchestration and Configuration with Answerable"
01:26 ben_e        is that a typo? googling answerable is not turning up likely suspects
02:46 codex        ben_e: they meant Ansible
02:46 codex        https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Northeast_Linuxfest_2014?rd=Northeast_Linuxfest_2013
02:47 codex        and the 2014: https://funnel.hasgeek.com/rootconf2014/1041-building-orchestration-and-configuration-with-ansi
10:25 pdurbin      ben_e: heh. answerable
12:33 dotplus      will any of the NELF talks be posted online?
12:33 pdurbin      dotplus: last year they posted ogg audio recordings
12:36 dotplus      I noticed a mention of "oggcasts" on the site, but nothing more than that. I'd be interested in the docket/"answerable":) talks
12:43 pdurbin      heh
14:10 PaxIndustria Morning
14:10 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: what up
14:12 PaxIndustria Opened that issue for discussion on the vagrant-generic repo! https://github.com/huit/vagrant-generic/issues/5
14:14 pdurbin      ah. Multiple Forks VS Branches
22:08 pdurbin      codex: I just noticed this: http://northeastlinuxfest.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/NELF2014_schedule.pdf
22:09 pdurbin      at http://northeastlinuxfest.org/?page_id=161
22:21 * pdurbin    just bought his ticket. paid a whole dollar
23:37 pdurbin      bear: heh. welcome! I guess you saw http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-03-31/line/1396308771 :)
23:37 bear         :)
23:37 bear         irc alerts are both a godsend and a bane
23:43 pdurbin      :)
23:43 pdurbin      semiosis: oh, I retired crimsonfubot yesterday so the nick's available... now's your chance to show us how to run a bot :)
23:44 semiosis     one of these days
23:44 pdurbin      wat
23:44 pdurbin      semiosis: you made it sound so easy :)
23:44 semiosis     i see what you did there
23:44 pdurbin      :)
23:45 bear         what kind of bot do you need?
23:46 pdurbin      bear: well, crimsonfubot was reborn, in a way, as searchbot
23:46 bear         ah
23:46 pdurbin      searchbot: lucky linux
23:46 searchbot    pdurbin: http://www.linux.com/
23:46 pdurbin      searchbot doesn't do much
23:46 searchbot    pdurbin: Error: "doesn't" is not a valid command.
23:46 pdurbin      :(
23:46 semiosis     searchbot: version
23:46 searchbot    semiosis: An error has occurred and has been logged. Please contact this bot's administrator for more information.
23:46 pdurbin      and I barely know what I'm doing
23:47 pdurbin      see?
23:47 bear         all bots are saddened by how much press hubots get nowadays
23:47 semiosis     hubot is a piece of crap
23:47 bear         agree!
23:47 pdurbin      semiosis is convince he can do better :)
23:47 pdurbin      convinced*
23:47 bear         the core of a bot is the irc and command handler - after that it's a matter of what functions you want to layer on top
23:48 semiosis     heh, when i looked into hubot it was a campfire bot & irc was an afterthought
23:48 pdurbin      well, what would a new crimsonfubot do for us?
23:48 semiosis     well, if it's a hubot, lots of pics of pugs & chuck norris of course
23:49 semiosis     i asked the github guys to open source their hubot plugins, the ones they're always talking about as being so damn useful... they said no
23:49 semiosis     so it's pugs & chuck norris
23:49 pdurbin      orly
23:49 semiosis     nothing more
23:50 pdurbin      searchbot: lucky chuck norris hubot
23:50 searchbot    pdurbin: https://github.com/github/hubot-scripts/blob/master/src/scripts/chuck-norris.coffee
23:50 semiosis     pretty sure there's more than one chuck norris plugin
23:50 pdurbin      meh
23:51 semiosis     anyway, i asked during one of the githubbers presentations, after he said no to releasing their plugins others in the crowd started groaning, when he said the code was ugly people shouted "WHO CARES??"
23:51 semiosis     i felt pretty satisfied
23:51 semiosis     :D
23:51 pdurbin      :)
23:51 pdurbin      well, they do open source a lot of good stuff
23:51 semiosis     such as?
23:51 semiosis     don't say hubot ;)
23:52 pdurbin      um. jekyll
23:52 * pdurbin    thinks
23:52 semiosis     haha
23:52 pdurbin      anyway
23:52 pdurbin      oh hey, is that github sexism scandal over? who won?
23:53 bear         we did - she left them to come to work for us (but seriously, no it's not, just got overshadowed by Mozilla scandal)
23:54 pdurbin      yeah. that was weird too
23:57 semiosis     bear: who's we?
23:57 bear         &yet
