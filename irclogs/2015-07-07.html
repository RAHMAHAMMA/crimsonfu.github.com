22:54 hydrajump if you want to `mv` all directories except for a list of directories is there a clever way to do this or would it require a short bash script to enumerate the directories and test match with the exclude list and then move or not?
22:55 hydrajump so the script would require two loops: one for the result of `ls` and one for the list of excluded dirs
23:31 hydrajump I found a solution
