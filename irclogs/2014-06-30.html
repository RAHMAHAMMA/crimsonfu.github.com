17:03 semiosis   from #gluster, [12:54] <JoeJulian> btw, semiosis, I officially hate ubuntu more than ever and consider it to be the least server friendly distro of any known distro.
17:03 semiosis   this seems a more appropriate channel
17:04 semiosis   JoeJulian: please do go on.  what specifically got you so worked up?
17:04 JoeJulian  Well, I suppose that's true....
17:05 JoeJulian  I love how, on a headless server, if there's a broken raid initramfs will drop you to a shell regardless of whether or not the raid is a necessary component to the operating system.
17:07 semiosis   JoeJulian: add 'nobootwait' to the fstab for that mount?
17:08 semiosis   or perhaps 'optional' is the right modifier.  see fstab(5), last para
17:08 semiosis   for the 4th field
17:09 JoeJulian  I looked through the code that produces the initrd file with initramfs_update and there is nothing to allow that to be bypassed.
17:10 semiosis   hmm ok if you say so.  i haven't had to roll my own initrd in a long time
17:10 JoeJulian  The only way I'm able to fix it is to remove the bits added by the mdadm_tools package
17:13 semiosis   JoeJulian: so even if this raid isn't in fstab, it still drops to shell?
17:13 JoeJulian  yep
17:19 JoeJulian  ... and in other news, did you hear that James Dyson might be leaving the company he founded?!?!?!?
17:20 * semiosis waits for the punch line
17:20 JoeJulian  ... I'm worried it will create a dangerous power vacuum.
17:20 semiosis   nice
21:01 ironcame1  pdurbin: is there still a #codefu channel?
21:10 pdurbin    ironcame1: #sourcefu, yes
21:13 pdurbin    JoeJulian: don't get mhayden started about ubuntu/debian: http://major.io/2014/06/26/install-debian-packages-without-starting-daemons/
21:18 mhayden    oh sheesh
21:18 JoeJulian  hehe
21:20 mhayden    the argument is that the daemons are okay to start because they're configured to listen on localhost or whatever
21:21 mhayden    but since you'd rarely go into prod like that, why start them <-- my question
21:21 JoeJulian  amen
21:42 * Whoop    has whinged about this for years
21:42 Whoop      but owell, if you're using daemons on a server you're using a config management system, so its easy to turn off auto start....for the minority of daemons that allow you turn off, grunt
21:52 JoeJulian  The easiest way to do that is to use centos. ;)
23:20 pdurbin    ironcame1: you've got some YAPC tidings for us?
