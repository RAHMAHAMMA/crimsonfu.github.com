12:41 pdurbin   eeep! "Roberts told investigators he took control of the airplane and caused it to climb and turn."
17:38 pdurbin   grr. getting http://security.stackexchange.com/questions/93117/firefoxsecure-connection-failederror-codessl-error-weak-server-ephemeral-dh-k on one of my servers
19:09 bear      yea, a lot of certs are going to need updating
19:10 pdurbin   but I got a SHA-2 cert. I thought I was all set
19:44 melodie   hi
20:08 pdurbin   melodie: hi
20:11 melodie   pdurbin a very new version of Bento Openbox Trusty, almost declared ok for all is out
20:11 melodie   annoucements plus gitlab for the project and more
20:12 melodie   http://linuxvillage.org/en/2015/07/bento-openbox-trusty-soon-final/

20:12 melodie   :)
20:59 bear      pdurbin - oh, this is because your dhparam value is < 1024
20:59 bear      which is not a cert issue but a web server issue - nginx, apache
21:31 pdurbin_m bear: hmm. ok
21:31 bear      do you control your web server?
21:34 pdurbin_m yeah. glassfish and apache
21:34 pdurbin_m not sure what changed
21:35 bear      the browsers now complain about the dhparam value being too low
21:35 bear      nothing changed on the server side
21:36 bear      see http://serverfault.com/a/693244 for a nice step-by-step to fix this
21:36 bear      for apache
21:40 pdurbin_m huh. ok. thanks. but I wonder why only one of servers is affected
21:41 bear      you mean apache vs nginx in general?
21:41 bear      they both are, I just posted about apache
21:42 bear      glassfish, nginx, apache are all needing to be updated to make sure the default dhparam they serve is > 1023 bits
21:43 pdurbin_m no no. I mean we have a lot of servers
21:45 bear      ohhh
21:46 bear      (can't help you with that one :)
21:46 pdurbin   :)
21:46 pdurbin   bear: well I'm glad to hear that maybe my cert is fine
21:47 bear      the only issue you could have with your cert is if you mix sha2 with non sha2 intermidiates
21:48 pdurbin   did I? here's the server in question: https://staging.dataverse.org
21:50 bear      your root cert is sha-1, two intermediates are sha-384 and then yours which is sha-256
21:51 pdurbin   bear: so what does that mean? I have a bad root certificate?
21:51 bear      "Your connection to staging.dataverse.org is encrypted with obsolete cryptography."
21:51 bear      i'm finding out more details - one sec
21:52 pdurbin   thanks. right, that's what chrome says
21:52 bear      yea, that's where I cut-n-pasted it from
21:53 bear      your cert is fine, it's the RC4 crypto and dhparam that are the culprit
21:53 pdurbin   bear: so what should I do, doctor?
21:54 bear      so fixing your cipher suite and dhparam...
21:54 bear      one sec - I have a great resource link for you on what cipher suite to use
21:54 bear      the tool I used to discover this is https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/analyze.html?d=staging.dataverse.org
21:56 bear      check this page - it will have guides to what cipher suite to use based on what level of backwards compatibility you need -- https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS
21:56 bear      it also has docs on how to update dhparam and other security items
21:56 pdurbin   ok, and then I should reconfigure apache based on the answer you linked: http://serverfault.com/questions/693241/how-to-fix-logjam-vulnerability-in-apache-httpd/693244#693244
21:57 bear      I would skip that completely and use the info that the moz wiki provides
21:57 bear      https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Apache
21:57 pdurbin   ah. ok. thanks
21:57 bear      the other was when I thought it was dhparam only :)
21:58 pdurbin   SSLCipherSuite parameter, looks like
21:59 pdurbin   gotta cook dinner but I'll check the logs. thanks, bear!!
22:00 bear      yvw
22:01 pdurbin   for anyone googling for this error, here it is: Problem loading page - Secure Connection Failed - An error occurred during a connection to staging.dataverse.org. SSL received a weak ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key in Server Key Exchange handshake message. (Error code: ssl_error_weak_server_ephemeral_dh_key)
22:03 mhayden   pdurbin: yeah, recent versions of nss just deny access to those sites with weak DH params
22:03 mhayden   at least firefox tells you why -- chrome just has a hard error with little explanation
22:07 JoeJulian I hate how mobile chrome does that. I can either visit a site overriding a cert failure, or not. I can't look at the cert to make my own determination.
22:47 pdurbin   firefox is just brutal. if you click "report this error" you get "Reporting the address and certificate information for staging.dataverse.org will help us identify and block malicious sites. Thanks for helping create a safer web!" :(
22:49 bear      wow, thanks for making me feel bad as a site owner firefox
23:24 pdurbin   conveniently, there's a checkbox for "Automatically report errors in the future" next to the "Report" button
