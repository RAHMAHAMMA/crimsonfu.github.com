00:15 pdurbin   melodie: in and out
00:15 melodie   ok
00:15 pdurbin   semiosis: welcome! lunch tomorrow at harvard square? :)
00:16 melodie   I had an idea about a page on a website where I was sent by a member of the #linuxchix chan and wanted to share this idea here in your chan with yourself
00:17 pdurbin   ok
00:18 melodie   when you have a few minutes available, no rush
00:18 melodie   :)
00:18 pdurbin   probably an hour or so? or go ahead and type and I'll catch up
00:23 melodie   I have been shown a website related to women in tech, Anita Borg place and I have seen the page containing the list of sponsors : I could see many from the Non Free software world and some from different companies but none from a company built on Free sofware
00:23 melodie   http://anitaborg.org/about/abi-partners/
00:24 melodie   so I think this deserves to be known, to encourage companies developing Free software to be shown in pages such as this one
00:31 melodie   good night
02:10 pdurbin   hmm, this programmer with a last name of Borg seems to have been a real person: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anita_Borg
02:12 pdurbin   lots of those companies develop free software: Google, Cisco, Amazon, Facebook, Yahoo, etc.
02:12 pdurbin   I guess you mean you don't see Red Hat or Canonical on the list?
03:12 GitHub191 [code] pdurbin pushed 1 new commit to master: https://github.com/crimsonfu/code/commit/345cc08e096e13a368e1f10e811c6cf808ca1638

14:11 semiosis  Point of DrQz's talk: plot data in such a way that you maximize the human brains pattern recognition ability
14:12 semiosis  Most plus/graphs are useless. .. load average vs time for ex
14:12 semiosis  s/plus/plots/

18:30 JoeJulian http://www.redhat.com/about/news/press-archive/2013/3/rackspace-red-hat-win-decisive-patent-victory
18:31 JoeJulian Doesn't that effectively invalidate every patented encryption algorithm out there?
18:32 pdurbin   good lord. "The complaint alleged that the processing of floating point numbers by the Linux operating system violated U.S. Patent 5,892,697."
