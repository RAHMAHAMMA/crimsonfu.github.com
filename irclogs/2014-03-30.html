01:00 pdurbin   hydrajump: oh, do answer your question, no I haven't played with docker. but maybe I'll go to a talk about it next weekend: "Will Weaver - Application Deployment Using Docker Containers" -- http://northeastlinuxfest.org/?page_id=161

10:42 melodie   hi
11:05 pdurbin   uh oh
11:07 pdurbin   where's crimsonfubot?!
11:08 pdurbin   has anyone seen crimsonfubot?!
11:08 * pdurbin looks everywhere
11:08 pdurbin   squee!
11:08 pdurbin   overnight crimsonfubot must have changed into... searchbot!
11:09 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky crimsonfu
11:09 searchbot pdurbin: http://crimsonfu.github.io/
11:09 pdurbin   but
11:09 pdurbin   does searchbot respond to "@" like crimsonfubot did?
11:09 pdurbin   @lucky crimsonfu
11:09 pdurbin   nope. good!
11:15 melodie   hi pdurbin
11:16 melodie   have you seen my question at #linuxvillage? http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2014-03-30#i_8514377
11:17 melodie   lost the bot? o_o*
11:18 pdurbin   :)
11:18 melodie   I am waiting for help with this sentence, because using "The" before would help me for some cosmetics in a slideshow
11:21 pdurbin   melodie: I'm replying to you in #linuxvillage
11:22 melodie   thanks!
13:02 pdurbin   heh. I just put "crimsonfu" as my organization: http://indiewebcamp.com/2014/Cambridge/Guest_List :)
13:03 pdurbin   I'd feel a little weird puting "Harvard" since this is just some side thing I'm interested in... nothing to do with work.
19:43 codex     hydrajump: yea - actually checkout shipyard
19:43 codex     super pretty web UI + gui
19:43 codex     probably one of the nicest web UIs i've used to date on a platform
19:43 codex     but you can write your own - all the status stuff is built into the "docker" binary
19:46 pdurbin   codex: want to come to that docker talk with me? http://northeastlinuxfest.org/?page_id=161 (other talks listed too)
19:47 hydrajump I'll checkout shipyard. I've been googling and reading different docker uses and came across boot2docker which might come in handy. I just need to install docker and play with it when I get time.
20:54 codex     pdurbin: sounds good - when is it? (i don't see a date)
20:54 codex     hydrajump: boot2docker is very very outdated
20:54 codex     just fyi
20:54 codex     they might've updated it recently though
20:55 codex     oh yea - they updated docker, but not lxc - but at least it's not like 8 versions behind anymore
20:59 hydrajump oh ok I didn't look at it that deeply just thought the idea was cool and possibly useful for a project I have in mind
21:00 hydrajump has docker become the focus of your day job codex
21:01 hydrajump architecting large docker deployments
21:12 codex     hydrajump: yea - i am actually looking at deploying most of our infrastructure on it - but first I want to move away from VMware, and i don't see that happening
21:12 codex     sadly, vCenter is VERY good to central stats/management
21:12 codex     and i haven't seen anything close to it on the kvm side
21:12 codex     but as hypervisors go - i much prefer KVM
21:12 codex     to your question - you can run docker anywhere, but i am looking to re-design quite a few things, but we are a few people short currently, so these things are on the back burner
21:13 pdurbin   codex: "April 5 of 2014 at the Residence Inn Marriot Hotel in Cambridge" Near MIT. http://northeastlinuxfest.org/?page_id=71
21:13 hydrajump codex I'm looking for work ;)
21:14 codex     hydrajump: seriously? I have 1 position open on our team
21:14 codex     pdurbin: great. I'll sign up (if there is a sign up)
21:14 hydrajump yeah just going to have dinner will be back in ~30min
21:14 hydrajump if you're still here we can chat
21:14 codex     hydrajump: send me a copy of your resume
21:14 codex     and let's talk at some point (casual)
21:25 pdurbin   codex: see also: http://irclog.greptilian.com/northeastlinuxfest/today :)
21:43 hydrajump I'm back
