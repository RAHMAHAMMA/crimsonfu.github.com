02:04 pdurbin      aw, someone wrote a tribute song to john siracusa for his final episode of hypercritical: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pOyDW_Y2Emo
02:04 pdurbin      via http://5by5.tv/hypercritical/100
02:05 pdurbin      sounds like he's still happy to get itunes reviews, but i've never written one. i don't even know if you can from linux
02:07 pdurbin      not everyone gets tribute songs written about them
02:09 pdurbin      ah, it's nice that the feed contains all the episodes: http://feeds.5by5.tv/hypercritical
13:54 jgtimmer     pdurbin: I liked the hypercritical a lot, started listening from the start, and onto episode 18 now
13:54 jgtimmer     shame it stops 2weeks after I started listening :-p
13:55 jgtimmer     I'm following linuxoutlaws now
14:27 pdurbin      jgtimmer: glad you're enjoying it. you might like http://siracusasaidso.com
14:28 pdurbin      i listened to linux outlaws solid for a good two years at least. great stuff but too many other podcasts i like even more
14:30 pdurbin      this reminds me vaguely of #crimsonfu: Bonobos will share with strangers before acquaintances - http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/01/130102173312.htm :)
16:22 pdurbin      speaking of podcasts, the stack exchange podcast doesn't work in MyPOD: http://meta.stackoverflow.com/questions/91539/stack-exchange-podcast-rss-feed-doesnt-work :(
16:22 pdurbin      i recently switched to downloading all my podcasts on my new android phone, which is awesome, in general. being able to manage it anywhere, i mean. rather than being tied to iTunes
21:02 jimi_c       pdurbin: saw your RT on kumofs, currently testing out couchbase which seems to be similar in function but a little easier to setup and definitely better documented
21:02 jimi_c       have you played with kumofs yourself?
21:13 semiosis     https://twitter.com/Cmdr_Hadfield/status/286948264236945408
21:23 jimi_c       ^ heh
21:41 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky couchbase
21:41 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://www.couchbase.com/
21:42 pdurbin      jimi_c: i'm played a tiny with with couchdb. is couchbase the same thing?
21:42 pdurbin      i haven't played at all with kumofs. just saw jeff darcy from redhat (gluster) tweet about it
21:42 pdurbin      https://twitter.com/Obdurodon/status/287161483769573376
21:43 pdurbin      "Not an actual FS, but http://kumofs.sourceforge.net is still one of the most under-appreciated scalable data stores out there IMO"
21:43 pdurbin      shuff and i played with moosefs once
21:43 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky moosefs
21:43 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://www.moosefs.org/
22:51 jimi_c       pdurbin: couchbase is basically a clustered memcached, with replicated data between nodes, failover, etc.
