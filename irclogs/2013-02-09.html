14:05 * pdurbin dinks around with his irc logger: http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2013-02-09#i_2894
15:38 pdurbin   heh
15:38 pdurbin   everyone should run this: traceroute 216.81.59.173
15:38 pdurbin   via https://plus.google.com/+CmdrTaco/posts/4o5EXpw69MK
16:31 * pdurbin asks a question: How can I see what I've typed in irssi? - Super User - http://superuser.com/questions/548875/how-can-i-see-what-ive-typed-in-irssi
18:12 ben_e     user a wider terminal? shift+enter in iterm makes it fullscreen
18:12 ben_e     i also like vim mode for irssi: https://github.com/shabble/irssi-scripts/tree/master/vim-mode
18:13 ben_e     so input line movement is not so painful
18:13 * ben_e   -&gt; go play in snow
18:35 pdurbin   ben_e: hmm, wider terminal is a good idea. i just hit the green button in Terminal.app. thanks
22:19 pdurbin   hadn't see http://secushare.org before. via http://irclog.greptilian.com/spanworm/2013-02-09#i_2960
23:17 pdurbin   oh noes! i had written up a very nice answer to my irssi question but it was lost due to site maintenance :(
23:17 pdurbin   so i posted another one. not as good
23:18 pdurbin   well, maybe it's better. short and sweet :)
