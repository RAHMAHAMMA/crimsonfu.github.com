15:42 melodie   strace*
15:42 melodie   sorry
15:45 melodie   knowing I want to invoque strace against a binary
15:48 melodie   oh I found
16:39 pdurbin   melodie: you got it to work?
17:12 melodie   yes pdurbin
17:12 melodie   thanks
17:12 melodie   and after that I broke the session, tried to repair, couldn't, then reverted back to the former version package
17:13 melodie   well testing the newer openbox patched for Debian/Ubuntu, the removal and revert back to stable didn't work that well
18:20 pdurbin   I don't have much in my strace notes
18:21 pdurbin   strace -fFttT -s 64 uptime # verbose debugging
18:21 pdurbin   strace -f -p `pidof clamcour` 2>&1 | grep write
