00:26 semiosis     using remotebox to manage virtualbox vms on a remote server
00:26 semiosis     pretty sweet
00:26 semiosis     so much easier than KVM
00:30 pdurbin      searchbot: lucky remotebox vm

00:31 pdurbin      RemoteBox : VirtualBox Client - http://knobgoblin.org.uk
00:32 pdurbin      good if you want a gui I guess
00:32 semiosis     http://remotebox.knobgoblin.org.uk/
00:33 semiosis     i could never get virsh console to work, had to rely on virt-manager to connect to my vm consoles, and that thing only worked 50% of the time
00:33 * semiosis   has had bad luck with kvm
00:34 semiosis     and configuring the host only network bridge was a pain in the you know what
00:34 pdurbin      even after all the virsh fu I dropped in here? ;)
00:35 semiosis     probably before you dropped that fu
00:35 semiosis     but tbh, i'm not interested in having to learn a ton of fu to run VMs
00:35 semiosis     vbox makes it easy, and things "just work" for me
00:35 pdurbin      meh. command line all the things, I say :)
00:36 semiosis     fair enough
00:37 pdurbin      I did use virt-manager plenty though
11:20 * pdurbin    couldn't help making a github/vader analogy: https://scrollback.io/gitlove/ :)
11:57 dotplus      I'm rather with pdurbin on the 'command-line' approach, or even taking it a bit further with a 'script it to perfect reproducability'.
11:58 dotplus      vbox is nice and convenient, especially since it's available on both linux/osx, but networking is ugh-awful slow
12:12 pdurbin      I usually don't keep my VMs running long. a few hours. a day
15:31 pdurbin      nice! Clay Christensen and Clay Shirky! http://www.centerdigitaled.com/events/Harvard-University-IT-Summit.html
15:37 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: hmm... "Docker & Vagrant are disrupting traditional application packaging, deployment, and management practices" ... http://www.centerdigitaled.com/events/Harvard-University-IT-Summit.html?page=agenda
15:38 PaxIndustria :)
15:38 pdurbin      PaxIndustria: sorry, I meant "Clay Christensen and Clay Shirky AND PaxIndustria!"
15:39 PaxIndustria LOL

22:18 * pdurbin    looks at https://github.com/ircanywhere/ircanywhere
22:18 pdurbin      wow, nice
