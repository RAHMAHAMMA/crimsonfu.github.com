15:32 skay    hi, I got distracted by offtopic things in #dvn talking about screen and tmux, wmii and dealing with X configs, my lenovo yogi ultrabook linux install annoyances and pdurbin suggested this channel
15:32 skay    I will idle here a little bit
15:40 pdurbin skay: your reasons for switching from screen to tmux make sense: http://irclog.iq.harvard.edu/dvn/2014-01-31#i_5941
15:41 skay    pdurbin: I've heard more sophisticated reasons for switching, but I have to be honest, I did not have those
15:42 pdurbin screen "just works" for me
22:34 melodie pdurbin I come just to drop a word to you, please tell your buddy on the other chan that I am still willing to have #torios logued. Just I don't have a regular internet connection since some floods damaged the lines in my area last week-end. we are still expecting them to be fixed, and for now I have only a 3G usb stick lend by the provider.
22:34 melodie see you soon...
