16:03 JoeJulian :D
16:05 JoeJulian pdurbin: Once I got 16384 (without cheating) I stopped playing. That'll be one of those things we look back at in another 20 years and realize how old we are.
16:05 pdurbin   holy crap
16:05 * pdurbin bows to JoeJulian's greatness
16:05 JoeJulian hehe
16:05 JoeJulian Or stubbornness.
16:05 pdurbin   JoeJulian: here I thought I had caught up with you
16:06 JoeJulian Now you have a new goal!
16:06 * pdurbin cries
16:07 pdurbin   JoeJulian: you did this in a browser? with no way to save your game?
16:07 JoeJulian correct
16:07 JoeJulian On an airplane in fact.
16:07 pdurbin   heh
16:54 pdurbin   JoeJulian: were those high numbers black too?
17:04 JoeJulian yes
17:04 pdurbin   ok
17:04 JoeJulian I didn't look at the source, but my guess is that there's just no color programmed for that high.
17:07 pdurbin   so we've both reached black. it's almost like we're equal ;)
17:07 JoeJulian totally!
17:08 semiosis  it's like you're the same person!
17:08 pdurbin   separated at birth
17:08 JoeJulian Hmm... I'm about to become a ceph expert too.
17:10 pdurbin   JoeJulian: in 20 years we'll ask people, "Did you ever see a black tile in 2048?" :)
19:13 JoeJulian Lol... Google recruiter: "We actually have a unique event that i wanted to chat with you about where you could showcase your skills in a different interview setting." Me: "No thank you. My skills are quite well known in the industry. If someone is looking for my specific skill set, anyone who's anyone will suggest my name. Those are the only interviews I entertain."
19:13 pdurbin   google emailed me this week too
20:02 JoeJulian "Ok. Sorry to bother you Joe. Just looking to chat about a position here. Let me know if anything changes on your end." -- What I didn't reply with is, "Yes, if I become obscure I'll let you know."
