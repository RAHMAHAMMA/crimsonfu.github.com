16:19 joshu_   hi
16:19 joshu_   pdurbin you're a freebsd guy, right?
16:20 joshu_   if so is a script in /rc.d only run once on first boot or every time the system boots?
16:31 joshu_   I found my answer
16:34 pdurbin  nope. linux. but I have no quarrel with bsd
16:34 joshu_   my mistake thought you used freebsd for some reason
16:35 joshu_   i'm trying to understand the difference between running insserv vs update-rc.d to install an init script
17:50 semiosis sometimes i wish i had reason to use BSD more
