21:21 codex     melodie: hi
21:21 codex     what's up?
21:21 melodie   I was wondering if there was a ml or a forum anywhere where people talk about FOSS electronics
21:22 melodie   this would be for my companion who is actually in a professionnal training where he is forced to use Windows... very poorly configured also
21:22 codex     FOSS electronics?
21:23 melodie   yes
21:23 codex     having a brain fart moment ...
21:23 melodie   that exists, doesn't it ?
21:23 melodie   I have seen many entries in Google, just typing "Free electronics" or such
21:23 codex     FOSS as in?
21:23 codex     oh free open source software?
21:23 melodie   Open Source

21:24 codex     obviously anythig w/ the arduino or respberry pi would be good contendors
21:26 melodie   right
21:27 melodie   I thought about places where people discuss about it, and talk about their experiences as others do on gnu/linux chans mailing lists, websites, forums...
21:29 ben_e     http://2013.oshwa.org/ &lt;- open hardware summit is in boston this year
