14:56 joshu        anyone know if there is a way to view your own Twitter timeline history? So I'd like to see tweets from people I follow that I've missed.
14:59 pdurbin      joshu: can't you... keep scrolling or something?
15:00 joshu        pdurbin yeah  but can't get further back than 10 days :(
15:00 joshu        just wondering if there is some way of viewing that history or if Twitter just doesn't allow it
15:01 pdurbin      hmm, with the API you can go back to something like 3200 of your own tweets. not sure about other people's tweets
15:03 joshu        pdurbin ok I guess whatever I've missed..I'e missed..no big deal
15:08 pdurbin      joshu: you should set up thinkup
15:09 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky thinkup
15:09 crimsonfubot pdurbin: https://www.thinkup.com/
15:09 pdurbin      to capure all those tweets
15:12 joshu        I'll have a look. Have you used it?
15:13 pdurbin      yep. not running it at the moment though. I like it. has an API
15:23 jgtimmer     joshu: that
15:23 jgtimmer     s a feature
15:24 jgtimmer     thinkup.org for the open source project, thinkup.com is a paying hosted version
15:24 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky thinkup github
15:24 crimsonfubot pdurbin: https://github.com/ginatrapani/ThinkUp
15:25 jgtimmer     woops, I was wrong about thinkup.org
15:31 joshu        sorry guys i'm confused. so thinkup is something that I would use to browse my twitter timeline history not just my tweets, but the tweets of those I follow
15:34 jgtimmer     joshu: it agregates and saves your tweets
15:34 jgtimmer     it's to late to use now
15:35 jgtimmer     but can help you in the future
15:35 jgtimmer     twitter only serves you up to a few days
15:35 jgtimmer     joshu: another option is to get a twitter client that pulls your tweets in every x hours, and saves them
15:37 jgtimmer     I also believe snapbird.org can doe this for you
15:37 jgtimmer     choose to search for your friends tweets, for your account
15:38 jgtimmer     it will allow you to scroll way further back in time
15:40 jgtimmer     so that you can use right now
15:51 joshu        cool thanks for the suggestions jgtimmer and pdurbin. I'll start with snap bird.org and see how I get onâ€¦regarding a twitter client that saves tweets do you know of any for Mac ?
15:52 pdurbin      joshu: nope but someone in #indiewebcamp might
15:53 joshu        ok thanks pdurbin
22:13 pdurbin      ./xmlsectool.sh --validateSchema --schemaDirectory /tmp/saml-2.0-os-xsd --inFile ~/fedlet/sp.xml
22:13 pdurbin      for all your SAML validation needs
