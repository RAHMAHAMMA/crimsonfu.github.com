00:18 hydrajump  I've been using termshare for several hours today and it's absolutely awesome!

00:18 hydrajump  Just need to get the server working selfhosted
00:19 hydrajump  I've just finished several termshare sessions with a guy in Russia
00:20 hydrajump  I've also just finished submitting a formula to install it using homebrew for you Mac OS X users :P
02:24 hydrajump  I'm terrible at sed and been scratching my head for a while now. Can someone please take a look at this: https://gist.github.com/anonymous/fc4c490a107a23379a34
02:25 hydrajump  I'm trying to get the sed to insert the lines with indentation, but there are two many leading spaces for each line
13:25 pdurbin    Native Win32 ports of some GNU utilities - http://unxutils.sourceforge.net
13:26 pdurbin    "native means the executables do only depend on the Microsoft C-runtime (msvcrt.dll) and not an emulation layer like that provided by Cygwin tools"
14:02 pdurbin    bene: I know you linked to http://vagrantbox.msopentech.com previously, but here's a nice landing page: http://msopentech.com/opentech-projects/vagrant/

14:59 whorka     it looks like sed is printing just as many spaces as you specified... de-indent the source?
16:23 hydrajump  whorka is there no way to keep the indentation, so that sed isn't all the way to the right which will look weird from a source code perspective?
16:23 hydrajump  Do you see what I mean?
16:42 whorka     mmmhmmm, so you want to embed a sed script in a another script but have the inner script follow the indent rules of the outer script even though it is all in one big single-quoted string
16:43 whorka     how about you stick the sed script string in an environment variable, then sed off the leading spaces before you run it? :)
16:54 whorka     this is actually a terrible idea b/c the escaping will get all weird... in general things like heredoc and embedded strings need to maintain their own indenting.
16:54 whorka     one workaround I've seen though is to concatenate your script into a string one line at a time. then each concatenation line can follow the indenting of the overarching script.
18:12 hydrajump  Thanks for your suggestions whorka.
18:34 hydrajump  anyone else having connection problems with freenode today?
18:36 semiosis   nope
