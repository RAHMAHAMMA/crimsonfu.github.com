16:16 whorka    pdurbin, there's active discussion on the rt-users mailing list right now about installing/configuring RT via puppet: http://lists.bestpractical.com/pipermail/rt-users/2012-August/077713.html
16:18 whorka    someone took a crack at it for Debian, https://github.com/lurdan/puppet-requesttracker , and there's a nascent repo for other distros https://github.com/rtcommunity/puppet
21:24 pdurbin_m huh. thanks. https://github.com/rtcommunity/
21:25 pdurbin_m oh, you posted that already :)
23:26 JoeJulian What an odd email. "If you send a pull request upstream I'll gladly accept it. :)" from a fork (on github) of a puppet module that I sent a pull request to (and it was merged) 6 months ago.
