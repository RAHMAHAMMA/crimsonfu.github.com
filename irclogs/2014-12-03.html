02:48 pdurbin    dotplus: I'm trying out `yum install python27-mod_wsgi` ... so far so good: https://github.com/IQSS/plaid/commit/4e81be485c7ad193d62896e2a4c78d14cc8a40e9
02:50 pdurbin    of course, our resident Django expert says uWGSGI is "definitely the preferred Django deployment (e.g. modern generation)"
02:50 pdurbin    and provided this link: Set up Django, nginx and uwsgi - https://gist.github.com/evildmp/3094281
09:12 prologic   IHMO (I'm biased) mod_wsgi/uwsgi are great and all (and WSGI ingeneral)
09:12 prologic   but you loose a lot of the benefits of better/smarter backends like say twisted.web, tornado, circutis.web
09:13 prologic   I tend to advise lighttpd/nginx + reverse proxy to your web app backend generally
09:13 prologic   scales better :)
12:10 pdurbin    prologic: that's cool. for now I'm just trying to get Django working on CentOS 6, which comes with Python 2.6, which is too old, hence all the jumping through hoops.
12:25 prologic   ahh
12:25 prologic   just build Python 2.7 from source :)
13:19 pdurbin    prologic: could do but `yum install python27` is easier: https://www.softwarecollections.org
21:08 prologic   pdurbin, ahh :)
21:08 prologic   that must be recent :)
21:12 semiosis   pdurbin: you like jq right?  can you help me?
21:12 semiosis   i'm finding the tutorial & manual lacking
21:13 semiosis   goal is to get a particular property from objects in an array where another property has some value
21:14 semiosis   for example... [{a: 1, b: x}, {a: 2, b: x}, {a: 3, b: y}] ==> show me all the a's where b is x ==> 1, 2
21:15 prologic   cat file.json | jq '. | [] | select(a=2) | .b'
21:15 prologic   I like jq too :)
21:15 semiosis   prologic: thanks!!!
21:15 prologic   the docs are fine
21:15 prologic   but yeah examples are lacking
21:15 prologic   it's something like the above
21:16 semiosis   the docs are terse.  and thats fine, but sometimes terse docs aren't enough
21:16 prologic   *nods*
21:16 prologic   hmm
21:16 prologic   I don't even have jq here
21:16 prologic   damint :/
21:16 prologic   going to have to port it for CRUX :)
21:17 prologic   anyway gotta get to work :) good lucky
21:17 prologic   luck*
21:18 semiosis   thx again
21:20 pdurbin    semiosis: I use jq 1000 times a day. love it. it even has recursive stuff
21:21 semiosis   pdurbin: would you do it the same as prologic?  or else what would you do?
21:22 pdurbin    hmm, if prologic's thing works...
21:22 pdurbin    SHIP IT!
21:23 semiosis   sadly, it doesnt
21:23 semiosis   error: a is not defined / . | [] | select(a=2) | .b                1 compile error
21:23 semiosis   i put in my example array
21:24 semiosis   but that expression isn't even well formed apparently
21:24 pdurbin    oh
21:24 pdurbin    bummer
21:25 semiosis   eh, ok, my example needed " around the bare chars
21:25 semiosis   but the expr is still bad
21:28 semiosis   ok ok, how about a simpler thing
21:28 semiosis   show me all the objects in an array where x = y
21:29 semiosis   how do I do that?
21:33 pdurbin    semiosis: if there's a #jq channel and they want me to log it I'm happy to
21:37 semiosis   pdurbin: can you just show me how to filter an array?
21:37 semiosis   i have an array of objects, i want to get the subset of objects where .foo == "bar"
21:37 pdurbin    can you just
21:37 pdurbin    he says
21:38 semiosis   i'm about to throw out this jq thing and *just* use php
21:38 semiosis   all i've ever been able to do with jq is pretty print stuff
21:45 pdurbin    semiosis: that's what I do most often but you may find some nuggets at https://github.com/IQSS/dataverse/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=jq
21:45 pdurbin    may
21:45 pdurbin    :)
21:45 semiosis   '.[] | if .b=="x" then .a else null end'
21:46 semiosis   that does what i want, mostly.  i am left with a null where b was y
21:46 pdurbin    curl -s 'http://localhost:8983/solr/collection1/select?rows=100&wt=json&indent=true&q=*&fq=dvtype:files' | jq '.response.docs[] | {name_sort, id, parentid}'
21:46 semiosis   but at least it gives me all the a's where b is x
21:47 pdurbin    I mentioned jq here: https://github.com/mit-cml/appinventor-sources/issues/96
21:47 pdurbin    "Perhaps it could have semantics like jq: http://stedolan.github.io/jq/ " :)
21:50 semiosis   ok, i can use empty instead of null
21:50 semiosis   that's nice
21:50 semiosis   this might actually be useful
22:08 semiosis   prologic: i think you meant this, ./jq '.[] | select(.b == "x") | .a'
22:09 semiosis   and i think i get jq now
22:09 semiosis   sharp learning curve on that thing
22:11 pdurbin    so sharp it hurts
22:12 semiosis   seriously
22:12 semiosis   i think a grammar would have helped a lot
22:12 semiosis   the syntax is so weird
22:12 pdurbin    yeah, I called it "semantics"
22:12 semiosis   it's a functional language
22:12 pdurbin    i dunno
22:12 semiosis   but with bizarre syntax
22:12 semiosis   no grouping, no s-expresseions
22:12 pdurbin    just like sed!
22:13 semiosis   lol
23:26 pdurbin    semiosis: can you please make your jq question into a kata? https://github.com/crimsonfu/code/tree/master/katas
23:27 pdurbin    then prologic can add his solution
23:27 semiosis   https://twitter.com/pragmaticism/status/540268171169918976
23:27 semiosis   that pretty much sums it up
23:30 semiosis   ok i'll kata
23:46 semiosis   https://github.com/crimsonfu/code/pull/1
23:46 semiosis   pdurbin: ^
23:50 semiosis   hang on still editing
23:51 semiosis   ok done
23:51 * semiosis gbtw
23:57 semiosis   pdurbin: and you can add yours too!
23:57 semiosis   s/yours/your solution/
23:57 pdurbin    7 commits? no squashing?
23:57 pdurbin    i kid
23:58 pdurbin    ok, merged
23:58 GitHub173  [code] pdurbin pushed 8 new commits to master: https://github.com/crimsonfu/code/compare/345cc08e096e...dbf4145ccc6e

23:59 pdurbin    man, I forgot about that git hooks. it's been so long since we worked on any katas
