12:49 melodie are there Debian addicts here? I'd like to ask about a command line, and also how to put it in a post-install script?
12:49 melodie this is the command line:
12:49 melodie update-rc.d zram defaults
12:50 melodie I don't know what "defaults" is supposed to refer to : I suspect it should be "default" as in "/etc/default/" but I am unsure about it
13:02 melodie ok, defaults is an option
13:15 pdurbin melodie: an option? you can leave it out? and just use "update-rc.d zram" instead?
13:16 melodie no you have to define one
13:16 melodie it's one among else
13:17 melodie it allows making the symlink which will trigger zram to be loaded and configured at boot time, and "defaults" says it will start in levels 2345
13:17 melodie so this is the required option for this start script
13:23 pdurbin hmm. ok
23:01 melodie good night
