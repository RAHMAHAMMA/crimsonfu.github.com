17:31 hydrajump  anyone on Mac OS X using `vim` as their editor instead of GUI editors such as Sublime or Atom?
17:47 * semiosis points at pdurbin
17:50 * dotplus  raises hand
17:51 semiosis   bonus points if you're using vim through tmux
17:51 semiosis   on a retina display
17:51 semiosis   ahahahaha
17:55 bene       heh
17:55 bene       all of those things apply to me
17:56 hydrajump  i'm giving `vim` a try for the first time.
17:57 semiosis   bene: please at least tell me those tmux/vim sessions are remote
17:57 bene       hydrajump: you were an emacs person before?
17:57 hydrajump  semiosis: what does tmux give you
17:57 hydrajump  bene: nope always GUI editor, e.g. started with sublime and then atom
17:58 semiosis   hydrajump: what kind of work are you doing?  programming?  sysadmin?
17:58 semiosis   tmux is a terminal multiplexer.  it's like screen.  lets you manage multiple terminal "windows" in a session, basically.
17:59 hydrajump  semiosis: ah ok used screen before.
17:59 hydrajump  semiosis: a combination devops
18:01 bene       i also run mutt on my MBP
18:02 bene       but i'm a bit of a masochist i suppose
18:02 hydrajump  but you guys stick to terminal vim and don't use macvim. vimr, neovim?
18:03 bene       terminal
18:05 semiosis   i just get endless laughs out of using that fancy hardware and "the world's most advanced operating system" to do tmux/vim
18:07 hydrajump  hehe
18:07 hydrajump  next step is to run debian/ubuntu on your Mac instead of OS X :P
18:08 hydrajump  https://twitter.com/frazelledazzell/status/556014610092797952 <-- Docker dev runs debian jessie on Mac
18:17 bene       that never made sense to me
18:18 bene       the beautiful thing about os x is the tight integration with the hardware
18:18 bene       the hardware is very nice kit, and then with os x, the media keys always work, the touchpad has super nice responsiveness/control, the power management is fantastic, etc
18:18 bene       and you lose all that by putting linux on the same hardware
18:18 * bene     shrugs
18:19 hydrajump  very true. however lately the beauty of os x is questionable. I hope they start getting things fixed before adding more features
18:19 hydrajump  i'm on 10.9.5. won't touch yosemite until I see improvements
18:19 bene       the last couple of releases have been glitchy
18:20 bene       my work machines are on 10.9 and the home machines on 10.10
18:20 bene       ubuntu 14.04 lts on the 6 year old macpro at work is pretty solid
18:25 hydrajump  yeah I run ubuntu server 14.04 and it works great for those use cases.
18:42 pdurbin    hydrajump: semiosis is right. I don't use a GUI version of vim
18:42 pdurbin    this works fine in the command line: https://github.com/pdurbin/vim-tsv :)
18:45 pdurbin    whorka: I have a sticker for you to remind you to go to this tonight: https://plus.google.com/u/1/+AsheeshLaroia/posts/cgf2d3Tmus1 :) a sticker of the sand cat from https://sandstorm.io

18:49 hydrajump  today no invites needed
18:52 hydrajump  or if you want a secure phone https://blackphone.ch/
19:21 semiosis   i dont always use an editor, but when i do it's vim in a terminal (a Konsole terminal, of course, because KDE)
19:21 semiosis   more often though i'm in intellij idea.  i'm even using it for puppet now.
19:34 bene       awww
19:35 bene       i thought the second half of the "i don't always use an editor" joke was going to be "but when i do, i use ed(1)."
19:47 * bear     hugs nano
20:04 semiosis   ed, or cat
20:07 larsks     Because ed is the standard text editor.

21:11 semiosis   i need to install imagemagick on my mac. should i use macports or homebrew?  what's the difference?
21:16 pdurbin    semiosis: homebrew
21:16 semiosis   why do you say that? i'm reading http://stackoverflow.com/questions/21374366/what-is-the-difference-usage-of-homebrew-macports-or-other-package-installation and there seems to be a lot of opinions on both sides
21:17 pdurbin    I just followed the herd. From fink to macports to homebrew.
21:17 semiosis   hm ok
21:20 larsks     semiosis: They are all terrible.
21:20 larsks     But I'm using homebrew these days.
21:21 semiosis   larsks: be that as it may, i can either use a windows PC or a mac to solve this problem, and I think mac is the lesser of those evils
21:22 larsks     semiosis: wow, dude.
21:22 larsks     I was not suggesting otherwise.
21:22 larsks     Only that most of the mac package maintainers have a variety of problem, so it's sort of a pick-your-poison.
21:33 pdurbin    larsks: the maintainers have problems? the people themselves? don't we all ;)
21:34 larsks     s/maintainers/managers/
21:34 larsks     Yeah, I spotted that.  I hoped it would be obvious :)
21:38 pdurbin    :)
22:13 semiosis   ok going to try homebrew. thanks for the input!
22:14 pdurbin    don't mention it
22:24 bene       i rather like homebrew
22:24 bene       especially in comparison to the other options
22:24 bene       :P
23:00 pdurbin    :)
23:46 hydrajump  semiosis: i'm been using and still homebrew never used macports, but I've talked to people who do not like the homebrew project.
23:46 hydrajump  I'm going to look at options when I reinstall OS X.
