17:20 pdurbin  hmm, I wonder how trustworthy this Flash APK for Android is: http://downloadandroidfiles.org/download-adobe-flash-player-11-1-1-apk/
17:40 pdurbin  found that link via How to stream Amazon Instant Videos on a Nexus 7 or other Android Tablet - http://www.teleread.com/amazon/how-to-stream-amazon-instant-videos-on-a-nexus-7-or-other-android-tablet/
17:48 pdurbin  hmm, http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/installers/archive/android/11.1.115.69/install_flash_player_ics.apk seems more official... via http://helpx.adobe.com/flash-player/kb/archived-flash-player-versions.html
17:55 pdurbin  hmm, the one on the unofficial site is even older (11.1.115.12 vs. 11.1.115.69): http://www.downloadandroidfiles.org/Files/Apps%20%28APK%29/Adobe%20Flash%20Player%2011.1%20%281%29.apk
18:03 pdurbin  ok, that official Flash APK from Adobe totally works. It allows me to watch Amazon Prime Instant videos on my Nexus 7. You simply install Dolphin Browser and enable Flash, after installing the official APK: http://download.macromedia.com/pub/flashplayer/installers/archive/android/11.1.115.69/install_flash_player_ics.apk
18:04 pdurbin  might be time to dump Netflix :)
18:11 pdurbin  especially since unlike Netflix, I can watch Amazon Instant Prime videos on Linux :)
20:11 pdurbin  ah, so to answer my original question, it seems like that APK from http://downloadandroidfiles.org is actually fine. the md5sum matches when I download the same version from Adobe
