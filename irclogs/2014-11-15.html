06:28 prologic   Hi folks
06:28 prologic   I'd like to announce a pre-release of autodock: https://registry.hub.docker.com/u/prologic/autodock/
06:28 prologic   autodock -- Automating Docker
11:51 pdurbin    nice
11:51 prologic   yeah actually
11:51 prologic   it is :)
11:51 prologic   building a hipache plugin now
11:51 prologic   that will let you dynamically setup vhosts for any web container
11:51 prologic   by simply running it with a VIRTUALHSOT env var
11:51 prologic   e.g:
11:52 prologic   docker run -e VIRTUALHOST=foo.bar.com -p 80:80 my_web_image
11:53 pdurbin    After Docker: Unikernels and Immutable Infrastructure â€” Medium - https://medium.com/@darrenrush/after-docker-unikernels-and-immutable-infrastructure-93d5a91c849e
11:53 pdurbin    semiosis: ^^
12:13 pdurbin    I was just saying yesterday that I'll feel like Docker has arrived when one of our users asks for us to distribute our application as a Docker container.
12:14 pdurbin    so far they've only asked for RPMs
12:38 prologic   heh
12:38 prologic   I'm sure they will eventually :)
12:39 prologic   Docker really is quite convenient though
12:39 prologic   even on the Desktop
12:39 prologic   just today, I wanted to convert a bunch of REDME.rst to README.md
12:39 prologic   (because the Docker Hub doesn't support rendering rst yet)
12:40 prologic   it's far eiaser to just run up someone's image of pandoc
12:40 prologic   thatn it is to install haskell and all the dependeices of pandoc
12:40 prologic   only to litter my system of something I'd hardly use :)
12:40 prologic   so now I have a ~/bin/rst2md
12:40 prologic   https://gist.github.com/b66bd4ddf4bd9e1b63cc
12:42 pdurbin    yeah, I use Vagrant for quick experiments in installing stuff I don't want on my laptop
12:44 pdurbin    prologic: do you always run docker as root?
12:44 pdurbin    when you do `docker run`?
12:45 prologic   err no never
12:45 prologic   always as my local user
12:45 prologic   also you should try it out yourself
12:45 prologic   as opposed to Vagrant
12:45 prologic   it's a hell of a lot faster to test things out :)
12:55 pdurbin    I don't *want* to execute `docker run` as root. It's just that the last time I tried Docker I was on Fedora and there's all this weirdness there about sudo and Docker and groups: https://docs.docker.com/installation/fedora/
12:56 prologic   oh
12:56 prologic   that's just bad documentation :)
12:57 prologic   what can I say -- developers suck at it
12:57 prologic   needless to say
12:57 prologic   install Docker
12:57 prologic   add yourself to the "docker" group
12:57 prologic   and you're done
12:57 prologic   no sudo or root this
12:57 pdurbin    ok, so you do have to add yourself to the "docker" group
12:57 prologic   all kinds of silliness of nob jokey sysadmins :)
12:58 prologic   yes b default the remote api (docker daemon) binds to /var/run/docker.sock
12:58 prologic   you can tweak this by editing the systemd/upstart/init (whatever) startup for Docker
12:58 prologic   docker --help
12:58 prologic   it's the -H option
12:58 prologic   e.g:
12:58 prologic   docker -H tcp://0.0.0.0:2375
12:58 prologic   237t is the standardized port
12:58 prologic   as recognized now by the (whatever that org is)
12:59 prologic   2375*
12:59 prologic   or you can have both like I do on my desktop
12:59 prologic   so I can access the Docker Daemon on my desktop via it's UNIX Socket at /var/run/docker.sock and via it's TCP endpoint from my MacBook Air
13:00 prologic   so on my MBA I can do:
13:00 prologic   docker run -i -t crux
13:00 prologic   and instantaneously get a crux linux env
13:09 pdurbin    ok, `sudo gpasswd -a pdurbin docker` (and logging out and back in) from https://docs.docker.com/installation/ubuntulinux/ seemed to work fine. and restarting docker
13:10 prologic   awesome :)
13:10 pdurbin    and now I'm in crux I think
13:10 prologic   welcome to the evil wonderful world of Docker :)
13:10 prologic   oh?
13:10 prologic   typing crux will find out :)
13:11 pdurbin    CRUX version 3.1
13:11 prologic   yeap :)
13:11 prologic   you are :)
13:11 prologic   docker run -i -t crux/python
13:11 prologic   :)
13:11 prologic   or even better
13:11 prologic   docker run -i -t --privileged crux/dind
13:11 prologic   Docker-in-Docker :)
13:13 pdurbin    running `rst2md index.rst` right now. it's downloading some stuff
13:14 pdurbin    downloading pandoc
13:17 pdurbin    and dependencies. slowly
13:19 prologic   ahh cool :)
13:19 prologic   it helps to have a fast connection sometimes
13:19 pdurbin    ever so slowly
13:19 prologic   often some folk are lazy and dont' optimize their iamges :)
13:20 prologic   I Dockerized my UNIX as an IDE Development Environment last week
13:20 prologic   so I can run my ide anywhere :)
13:20 prologic   it's ~1.2G in size
13:20 prologic   good thing my new job has Fibre :)
13:20 pdurbin    so it's an image not a container?
13:22 pdurbin    searchbot: lucky docker image vs container
13:22 searchbot  pdurbin: http://docs.docker.com/terms/container/
13:23 pdurbin    ok, so images are read-only
13:24 pdurbin    containers are read-write
13:24 prologic   the life-cycle is
13:24 prologic   Image -> Container
13:24 prologic   a Registry (e.g: Docker Hub) stores Images
13:24 prologic   Docker runs Containers
13:24 prologic   it also builds Images
13:24 prologic   etc :)
13:24 prologic   the whole ecosystem
13:24 pdurbin    an image is like a snapshot of a container? I'm seeing `docker commit`
13:25 prologic   yes containers are read/write
13:25 prologic   however when they are terminated and removed
13:25 prologic   all data is lost
13:25 prologic   images are immutable
13:25 prologic   umm
13:25 prologic   images are built up of layers
13:25 prologic   using COW - Copy on Write
13:25 prologic   AUFS, BRTFS, devmapper
13:25 prologic   are the main storage backends supported right now
13:26 prologic   I use BTRFS myself here
13:26 prologic   docker commit is useful for building images by hand
13:26 prologic   e.g:
13:26 prologic   docker run -it ubuntu /bin/bash
13:26 prologic   ; install some crap
13:26 prologic   ; exit
13:26 prologic   docker commit ...
13:26 prologic   then you have a new image based off ubuntu
13:27 prologic   however caveat:
13:27 prologic   this is not easily reproducible
13:27 prologic   since you did it by hand :)
13:27 prologic   so learn to user/write a Dockerfile
13:27 prologic   lots of examples at https://bitbucket.org/cruxlinux/
13:28 pdurbin    I'm sure I'll learn more as I play around.
13:28 pdurbin    rst2md is still downloading gigabytes of pandoc dependencies
13:28 pdurbin    well, one of them is over 600 MB at least. dunno the total
13:33 prologic   $ docker images | grep pandoc
13:33 prologic   jagregory/pandoc           latest              be6297221dd3        8 months ago        2.143 GB
13:34 prologic   apparently huge
13:34 prologic   one good reason why I didn't want to isntall it locally :)
13:34 prologic   also lazy image author/maintainer
13:34 prologic   probably didn't do an apt-get clean and/or merge multiple RUN statements (optimizing the image)
13:36 prologic   http://code.activestate.com/recipes/578963-guess-a-number-2-the-computer-attempts-to-guess-yo/
13:36 prologic   geez christ
13:36 * prologic weeps
13:36 pdurbin    done! and now I have an index.md file. neat!
13:37 pdurbin    and now it's fast to conver the next file. no downloading :)
13:38 pdurbin    yeah, my /var/lib/docker/aufs is 2.9 GB now
13:39 prologic   *nods*
13:39 pdurbin    http://blog.thoward37.me/articles/where-are-docker-images-stored/ could get to the point faster ;)
13:39 prologic   well locally in /var/lib/docker
13:39 prologic   by default
13:39 prologic   /data/docker on my desktop :)
13:39 prologic   but one should not really look inside or touch the data storage area :)
13:40 prologic   it's all black magic :)
13:40 prologic   Also handy tip for when you get to building images
13:40 prologic   docker rmi -f dangling=true
13:40 prologic   remove stale dangling images
13:43 prologic   https://pypi.python.org/pypi/hipachectl/0.0.1
13:43 prologic   cool ^^^ :)
13:43 prologic   one of my docker related tools is seeing some use
14:13 pdurbin    I guess the first thing I think is "where would I host a Docker image I create?"
14:13 pdurbin    it's easy to host a PHP app
14:13 pdurbin    and I'm used to deploying Java webapps now
14:14 pdurbin    and Django, a bit
14:14 pdurbin    I've stood up Ruby on Rails apps
14:15 pdurbin    CGI is easy
14:16 pdurbin    it would be interesting if our ops people said, "We'd like a Docker image of your app. We love hosting Docker images/containers."
14:26 pdurbin    the argument for writing apps in PHP because they're so easy to deploy: http://werd.io/2014/8-tips-for-writing-open-source-web-apps-that-anyone
14:47 pdurbin    I guess I'm thinking it would be interesting if Docker becomes so popular that it becomes a common way to deploy apps.
19:00 pdurbin    bear: heh. nice to see you mentioning Circuits: http://indiewebcamp.com/irc/2014-11-15#t1416075419484
19:00 bear       :)
19:00 bear       I use and like circuits a lot
22:43 prologic   bear, oh really ?
22:44 prologic   I haven't seen you before though :)
22:44 prologic   what do you use circuits for?
23:18 pdurbin    bear: ah. cool. I don't know a ton about circuits but I learn a bit here and there in #circuits
