14:16 dotplus   perhaps a bit basic for most folks here, but for the areas you're not familiar with, some of these might be good starting points: https://www.bento.io/grid
14:25 pdurbin   I'm not sure I'd call sublime "foundational". Nor terraform, whatever that is.
14:40 dotplus   yeah, I would object to some of the categorisations, but it looks like a promising list.
14:41 dotplus   "json" is "database"? err, no.
14:41 dotplus   s/list/source/
14:57 pdurbin   oh sure, it's a good list
15:16 bene      they should just put the word "opinionated" in the description
15:16 bene      then it's totally defensible because everyone is entitled to their crappy opinions!
15:26 dotplus   ha
15:57 westmaas  seems like foundational means infrastructural in that list - if you stretch your mind to include an editor as infrastructure to code writing
16:18 * pdurbin stretches his mind
16:41 * dotplus yogas his mind
