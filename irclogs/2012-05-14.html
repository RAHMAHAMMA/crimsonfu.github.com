13:39 gridiron Can't recall where I was talking about this but this module fixed my issues: http://wiki.nginx.org/HttpMemcModule
13:40 gridiron Well...one of my issues. I still miss my mum.
13:40 pdurbin  gridiron: i don't think it was here. . . but glad it's fixed :)
13:40 gridiron Well...if it wasn't here it must not have mattered much.
13:41 pdurbin  that's right
13:41 pdurbin  we only talk about stuff that matters
13:41 pdurbin  just like. . . slashdot. . . i guess
13:52 SEJeff   gridiron, I miss your mum too
13:52 SEJeff   *now* it is like /.
13:52 SEJeff   And I'm of course kidding
14:01 gridiron you know she died last year, right?
14:01 * SEJeff is a horrible person. I'm sorry
14:01 gridiron LOL
14:01 pdurbin  guys, please stay on topic
14:01 gridiron Success
14:01 SEJeff   troll the troll?
14:01 SEJeff   awesome
14:02 pdurbin  here. talk about this:
14:02 pdurbin  Ken Thompson used "assembler on a GE-635 machine. . . A postprocessor generated a paper tape readable by the PDP-7. These tapes were carried from the GE machine to the PDP-7 for testing until a primitive Unix kernel, an editor, an assembler, a simple shell (command interpreter), and a few utilities (like the Unix rm, cat, cp commands) were completed." -- http://cm.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html
14:03 gridiron And there are those out there that believe this was a bad move... along with coming down out of the trees.
14:03 pdurbin  :)
14:04 pdurbin  paper tape!
14:04 pdurbin  "After this point, the operating system was self-supporting: programs could be written and tested without resort to paper tape, and development continued on the PDP-7 itself."
14:04 SEJeff   Thats disturbingly hardcore
14:06 pdurbin  kids today don't appreciate what they've got
14:06 pdurbin  "yum's too slow!" --ironcamel
14:06 SEJeff   Ken is probably in the "asm is for sissies" camp
14:12 pdurbin  speaking of yum. running it now. i've decided it's silly to run centos on my workstation at work. fedora has been stable enough at home. making the switch
14:12 pdurbin  plus, i've mitigated my various annoyances with gnome 3
14:14 pdurbin  SEJeff: do you use one of these "spot" repos for chromium? https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Chromium
14:14 pdurbin  http://repos.fedorapeople.org/repos/spot/
14:20 SEJeff   I do
14:22 pdurbin  ok. thanks
15:16 SEJeff   Went to this: http://www.meetup.com/LA-Hackathons/events/62796642/?a=co1_grp&amp;rv=co1 and found out a lot more than I ever knew about node.js
15:17 SEJeff   node apparently can do zeromq. That was news to me.
15:26 shuff    pdurbin: aso you may recall, spot is this guy: http://spot.livejournal.com/312320.html
15:26 SEJeff   He runs the entire desktop team @ redhat. Great guy
17:14 pdurbin  his avatar is a cat
17:15 pdurbin  had never really thought of node.js + zeromq. . . node.js performance with zeromq vs. Python vs. Java - Stack Overflow - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6645796/node-js-performance-with-zeromq-vs-python-vs-java
17:19 SEJeff   pdurbin, Neither had I
19:22 pdurbin  sort -n -t . -k 1,1 -k 2,2 -k 3,3 -k 4,4 # Sort IP Addresses with GNU sort - http://www.madboa.com/geek/sort-addr/
