01:09 mhayden   JoeJulian: pulp fiction is highly recommended
01:09 mhayden   i'm a fan and i finally made my wife watch it two years ago -- she didn't get it
10:25 pdurbin   mhayden: â–¶ check out the big brain on brad - YouTube - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hrm-rPSCIBw :)
11:15 pdurbin   Cozy, a personal cloud you can hack, host and delete - http://cozy.io
12:04 pdurbin   Sandstorm Personal Cloud Platform - Take control of your web http://sandstorm.io
12:04 pdurbin   and you thoughts there was only http://owncloud.org ;)
12:37 dotplus   I was aware of owncloud, heard of sandstorm, but cozy.io is new to me.
15:05 hydrajump pdurbin where do you find all these cool projects?

16:32 * pdurbin is sitting in a meeting with codex :)
18:02 semiosis  i just heard of this one the other day, Seafile: http://seafile.com/en/product/private_server/
18:15 pdurbin   "Next-generation Open Source Cloud Storage with advanced features on file syncing, privacy protection and teamwork!"
18:15 pdurbin   wow. teamwork
18:18 dotplus   I think the differences are mostly of emphasis. seafile is (almost) entirely about file storage, sandbox/cozy seem to be focussed on offering a PaaS you can run at home and owncloud is somewhere in the middle
18:42 pdurbin   ok
18:42 pdurbin   perl -lane 'print "$F[0] $F[2] $F[3] $F[4] $F[1]"'
18:42 pdurbin   ironcamel: help! me dumb
18:43 pdurbin   sivoais: ^^
18:43 pdurbin   how to combine 2 though 4 please
18:43 pdurbin   instead of listing them separately
18:43 pdurbin   need a range or whatever
18:45 sivoais   perl -lane 'print "$F[0] @F[2..4] $F[1]"' # use an array slice
18:45 sivoais   pdurbin: ^
18:45 pdurbin   sivoais: thank you!!
18:46 sivoais   :-)
