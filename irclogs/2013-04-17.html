17:00 pdurbin      hmm, I'm looking at https://trac.adium.im/wiki/TabbedMessaging but I don't think Adium has "Meta-a" like irssi or weechat to switch to the tab with activity
17:01 semiosis     aw and you can't configure keyboard shortcuts?  konversation lets you keyboard everything
17:08 pdurbin      dunno. i just know I'm addicted to Meta-a now
