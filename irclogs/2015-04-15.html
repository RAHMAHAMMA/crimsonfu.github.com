00:02 pdurbin  I guess I'm thinking of the XServe ... the rack mounted thing

14:08 dotplus  hey, if you want IoT, you should look at Cisco, they're making a huge push into IoT. ALso, I hear we're hiring:)
14:09 prologic I've built one such IoT project so far :)

14:14 dotplus  nice. I wish we could be out of the city and/or have more than 17' x 25' of garden. But our move to non-city (surburban .tn.us) failed so badly that it's a case of once bitten, twice shy.
14:15 dotplus  so it looks my hopes of bees/chickens/mushrooms are a lot further off.
14:20 prologic that's a shame
14:24 dotplus  yeah and really it was mostly not due being out of the city so much as the feel of the area (awful modern surburban housing development, known as "subdivision"), compunded with all sorts of other factors including new baby, new job. (baby is now no longer new and this was the previous job).
14:29 semiosis thanks for the synology tip.  got a ds415+ and it's really great
15:04 bene     awesome
15:05 bene     semiosis: did you ever get a power usage reading on that pfsense machine you built up?
15:06 semiosis bene: i havent done any measurement but it has a 60W/5A power supply, http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16856205007
15:07 semiosis bene: having problems with it though, maybe bad ram or mobo, or some pfsense driver issue
15:07 semiosis needs to be rebooted every few days :(
15:08 bene     bummer
15:09 bene     my older alix 2d2 runs about 4w at 100% CPU usage and it's rock solid, but starting to feel a bit slow
15:13 bene     a fully kitted out APU board is about $200 and should also run under 10w, but it's a more limited platform than a full atom pc
20:02 melodie  hi
20:25 larsks   melodie: hallo!
20:26 melodie  hi larsks :)
