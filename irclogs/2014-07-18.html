13:04 pdurbin   hmm, wanted to convert a png to text with ocr on mac. `brew install gocr` worked but homebrew doesn't seem to have pngtopnm
13:04 pdurbin   which on linux I used like this: pngtopnm foo.png | gocr -
13:05 pdurbin   this was a one off thing so this worked fine: Free Online OCR - Convert JPEG, PNG, GIF, BMP, TIFF, PDF, DjVu to Text - http://www.newocr.com
15:41 semiosis  pdurbin: you know android can do ocr?  can scrap text right out of a photo taken with the camera.  super convenient
15:41 semiosis  scrape*
16:43 pdurbin   hmm. I didn't
16:43 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky android ocr

16:43 * pdurbin smacks searchbot
16:49 pdurbin   semiosis: I believe you. I'll hunt around later
16:54 semiosis  pdurbin: use the google keep app.  take a photo with it, then choose grab image text from the menu
18:18 pdurbin   huh. :set nobomb in vim to get rid of <U+FEFF> (BOM: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_order_mark ). Had downloaded the file from google docs
18:18 pdurbin   semiosis: will do in a bit. thanks

23:30 pdurbin   semiosis: so, you're right. Google Keep app works for ORC, kinda. The conversion was much worse though. The PNG is from here if you care to try: https://groups.google.com/d/msg/dataverse-community/R4yJSD2lhHo/9nI5TR19OEcJ
