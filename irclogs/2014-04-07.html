00:02 pdurbin   huh. interesting
00:03 pdurbin   someone offered me an invite to github's new editor. atom or whatever. but I'm happy with vim. :)
00:08 melodie   codex wao wao!
00:09 melodie   when will that hit Europe?
00:09 melodie   :)
00:17 Whoop     well, considering its specific to amazon fresh, which doesnt exist in europe - I'd guess not for a long time
00:18 Whoop     hell, doesnt even exist in most of the US yet, so years :)
00:21 melodie   have to go, good night
00:22 melodie   Whoop ok! ^^
00:41 hydrajump wow amazon dash...the future of grocery shopping
00:42 hydrajump why are databases so complicated :(
00:44 pdurbin   complicated?
12:24 pdurbin   this was really good, well worth listening to: http://theshipshow.com/2014/03/deciphering-the-docker-lifestyle/
12:26 pdurbin   and they mentioned this, which is awesome: http://www.wei-wang.com/ExplainGitWithD3/
12:27 pdurbin   kinda similar to http://pcottle.github.io/learnGitBranching/
12:28 pdurbin   but anyway, they asked for feedback about their docker episode. twitter works: https://twitter.com/ShipShowPodcast/status/450673710630838272
15:53 semiosis  pdurbin: all the java web apps i've used ship with an embedded web server, usually jetty.
15:53 pdurbin   hmm
15:54 semiosis  although tomcat can be embedded as well
15:54 pdurbin   yeah, that's how solr ships
15:54 pdurbin   with jetty
15:54 pdurbin   semiosis: do any of these apps use a database?
15:54 semiosis  of course
15:54 pdurbin   how is the database setup done?
15:55 semiosis  usually they ship configured with sqlite, which you use to play with on first run, then you edit a config file & replace the sqlite config with your sql db config
15:55 semiosis  sonarqube, jenkins, and jira all are like this
15:56 pdurbin   ok. or could use h2 or that other h thing. to start. then switch to postgres or whatver later
15:56 semiosis  right
15:57 pdurbin   semiosis: so would you dump the schema from sqlite and then create the schema from it in postgres? (for example)
15:57 pdurbin   for us, the postgres schema, the tables, get created when we deploy to glassfish
15:57 semiosis  right
15:57 semiosis  you could also provide a db script the user has to run to set up their schema
15:58 pdurbin   hmm. yeah, could do
15:59 pdurbin   i don't have a lot of database fu
16:19 mattdm    this is a random test of unicode support: ♪€°☠☂
16:21 pdurbin   mattdm: ilbot3 can handle it :)
16:22 * pdurbin checks: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2014-04-07#i_8553151
16:22 pdurbin   yep
16:22 mattdm    apparently ircii is fail :)
16:22 mattdm    my android phone client doesn't have complete font support
16:22 mattdm    no pirates or umbrellas
16:23 pdurbin   mattdm: this is what I use: Yet Another Android IRC Client - Yaaic - http://www.yaaic.org/
16:34 pdurbin   semiosis: I'm sure an RPM for our app would be appreciated. I was talking to mattdm about this over the weekend
17:28 semiosis  anyone ever connect visualvm to a remote tomcat7?  i'm having a real hard time getting this to work
17:28 semiosis  all the web sites say the same thing, but it just doesnt work
17:34 semiosis  hah, got it!
17:46 pdurbin   hmm. visualvm. that's what netbeans uses but maybe I should fire it up independently
17:47 semiosis  i need to track down a memory leak in prod
17:48 semiosis  visualvm + jmx to the rescue
17:48 pdurbin   hmm
17:48 pdurbin   yeah, I need to look at performance generally
17:57 semiosis  argh.  remote memory monitoring is only in java 8
18:00 semiosis  looks like you can make a heap dump on the remote host, then analyze the file locally
19:46 pdurbin   "The other problem with Travis is that it’s a CI solution, not a proper testing solution." -- http://www.sitepoint.com/testing-across-node-js-versions-using-docker/
20:13 hydrajump pdurbin my "databases are complicated" comment was related to a possible web app I'm trying to decide if I can develop for a friend.
20:15 hydrajump There seems to be two camps when it comes to developing modern web apps today: rails/ postgres and node/express/mongodb or something similar.
20:18 pdurbin   yeah
20:18 pdurbin   we're in the postgres camp
20:18 pdurbin   but in the office next to mine.. the mongo camp :)
20:22 pdurbin   oh, there's also a "polyglot persistence" camp
20:32 skay      pdurbin: hey Max Ogden is going to talk about dat at the next mozilla science lab call https://etherpad.mozilla.org/sciencelab-calls-apr10-2014
20:56 hydrajump pdurbin have you built anything with node.js?
21:04 pdurbin   hydrajump: nope. but if I did I'd probably start with a command line app: https://www.npmjs.org/browse/keyword/cli
21:05 pdurbin   skay: does that get recorded as a podcast?
21:05 skay      pdurbin: I do not know
21:05 pdurbin   ok
21:56 ben_e     https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/CVE-2014-0160 <- nasty openssl security bug... whee!
21:56 ben_e     http://heartbleed.com/ <- also
22:30 pdurbin   nasty
22:38 pdurbin   I remember back when every bug didn't get its own domain
23:02 skay      pdurbin: no podcast. I asked
23:16 pdurbin   bummer
23:16 pdurbin   I just started listening to this and so far so good: http://www.internethistorypodcast.com
