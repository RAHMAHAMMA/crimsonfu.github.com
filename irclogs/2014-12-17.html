14:45 GWG       Anyone good with Nginx around?
14:45 GWG       https://github.com/dshanske/nginx-cache-control/blob/master/example.conf
14:46 GWG       Looking to figure out an elegant way to restrict the header initiated purge to localhost.
15:49 bear      gwg - you could check if $domain is "localhost"
16:09 GWG       Bear, you can not have nested ifs
16:32 bear      then setup a location for localhost and share the internal bit
16:50 GWG       Can you restate that?
17:15 bear      each location {} block can be for a regex that you can then "include foo.conf" for the details
17:16 bear      so:   server { server_name localhost; include stuff.conf; }
17:16 bear      server { server_name www.example.com; include stuff.conf; }
17:17 bear      then you can duplicate but only have a single file to edit for each different server name
17:20 GWG       Bear, that would not work. I have more than one site on the server.
17:21 GWG       So, the localhost couldn't figure out what data to serve.
17:24 bear      oh - sorry for missing that detail :/
17:25 GWG       Bear, no problem.
17:25 GWG       For now, no one has DDOSed me using it on the years I've had this setup.
17:26 GWG       But I want to close the door
17:30 GWG       I have a different idea
17:30 GWG       What if I just vary the trigger?
17:46 GWG       I can just change the header.
17:53 bear      true, good idea
18:14 GWG       Instead of it being 1,it can be a random number I can change.
18:14 GWG       Bear, thank you for helping me come to that conclusion. Sometimes you just need a sounding board
18:15 bear      glad to be helpful! (yes, having someone to talk out a problem is a huge help)
18:17 GWG       Bear, if you are interested in the solution, I can show you the setup
18:17 GWG       I've started a repository for it.
18:17 pdurbin   talk to the bear: http://wiki.greptilian.com/programming
18:17 bear      nifty - yes, always interested in how people use nginx
18:18 bear      oh my - that is so cool pdurbin !
18:19 GWG       https://github.com/dshanske/nginx-cache-control/blob/master/example.conf
18:19 GWG       Pdurbin, perfect
18:20 pdurbin   :)
18:20 GWG       The example was based largely on one written by Mark Jaquith. I need to add references/credit
18:20 * pdurbin imagines bear as a bear
18:22 bear      I like it
18:24 GWG       Pdurbin, that is how the teddy bear was invented
18:30 pdurbin   :)
19:19 pdurbin   what's a word for having more permission than you should?
19:23 pdurbin   if I don't have a permission I should it's "missing". but what's the opposite?
19:47 pdurbin   hmm. maybe I could call it an "illegitimate" permission
20:00 semiosis  excess?
20:00 pdurbin   could work but doesn't sound scary enough :)
20:01 pdurbin   maybe a "revoked" permission
20:02 semiosis  unauthorized
20:02 semiosis  you may technically have the permission, although you dont have the authority to use it
20:02 semiosis  and scary too
20:02 pdurbin   yeah
