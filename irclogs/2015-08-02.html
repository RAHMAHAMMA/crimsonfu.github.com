15:36 melodie   hi
15:38 melodie   pdurbin I have tested microca.st with pump.io since 2 days and I realized only now that the posts are not public and not possible to setup the account to make them public. So I wonder if another place where simple notes such as this could be found?
15:38 melodie   does anyone know about Gnu Social for instance? How are the servers?
