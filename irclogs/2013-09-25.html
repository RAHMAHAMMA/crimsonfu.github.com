11:52 melodie   hi
11:53 melodie   chasmo ?
14:02 chasmo    morning melodie
14:12 melodie   hi chasmo
14:12 melodie   how are you?
16:39 pdurbin   chasmo is usually pretty quiet :)
23:17 pdurbin   failure is inevitable -- http://irclog.greptilian.com/javaee/2013-09-25#i_25709
23:25 melodie   pdurbin is there wind blowing in the code?
23:26 pdurbin   melodie: hmm? :)
23:27 melodie   you said about failure so I was asking if there's wind blowing through the code? Does the code have holes?
23:28 pdurbin   even in the code has no holes... there are still failures :)
23:28 pdurbin   and code always has holes anyway :)
23:29 pdurbin   melodie: have you seen the Netflix monkeys? http://techblog.netflix.com/2011/07/netflix-simian-army.html :)
23:29 melodie   ooo k
23:29 melodie   let me see
23:30 melodie   pdurbin ah the weak link
23:30 melodie   fun
23:30 melodie   I think of a recent event
23:31 melodie   I was working on my website and on a friend's website since a few days, and I wanted to check something on it later another day, in the morning
23:31 melodie   no website...
23:31 melodie   my website gone too
23:31 melodie   going to the website of the host:
23:31 melodie   no website either
23:31 melodie   aha
23:32 melodie   I had to leave the house for some appointements outside so I quit the computer and went
23:32 melodie   when I came back, the one of the host was back, and also our websites, but soooo slow
23:32 melodie   the host did'nt have any problem
23:33 melodie   our sites didn't either
23:33 melodie   some provider (big provider) upstream had a power failiure which affected a large part of the network
23:34 melodie   I think we lost at least half a day availability of our websites
23:34 melodie   if not more really
23:35 * pdurbin cries
23:35 melodie   pdurbin it was a "IP transit" issue
23:35 pdurbin   oh
23:37 melodie   and the host reacted fast, he says, but on the client side we all have been impacted as long as our ISP's had not yet switched to another route (so I explain from what I read in French, to how I know best to explain, in English)
23:39 melodie   ok, pdurbin I wish you the best with the code, and am now heading to bed. :)
23:39 melodie   thanks for the netflix link
23:41 pdurbin   sure :)
