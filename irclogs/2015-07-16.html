14:58 pdurbin   bear: now that I'm actually on that server with the weak ephemeral Diffie-Hellman key in Server Key Exchange handshake message I'm realizing that https is being served by glassfish, not apache. Glassfish 4
15:07 bear      I have never used the modern versions of Glassfish and my foray into JavaDocs trying "glassfish ssl configuration" was yielding nothing
15:10 pdurbin   you know what? I'm pretty sure this server is just oddly configured. Gonna try to get it back to a more normal config. sorry for all the noise
15:11 pdurbin   ok. yeah. back in business
15:12 bear      no worries :)
15:20 * pdurbin sends the all clear
15:22 bear      \o/
15:23 pdurbin   bear: thanks again. much appreciated
15:23 bear      anytime
