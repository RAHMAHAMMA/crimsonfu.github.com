14:45 hydrajump Just got this security heads up in another channel http://www.reddit.com/r/linuxadmin/comments/23vhtd/anyone_seeing_weird_ssh_user_accepted_logs/
15:05 Whoop     had some weird sequential nagios alerts on two seperate SSH boxes 4am Friday, nagios paged me with nothing but "Server answer:" from SSH
15:05 Whoop     nothing odd in logs other than a ton of normal invalid user attacks
15:05 Whoop     zero clue to what that means, will read the nrpe check code shortly
15:05 Whoop     s/Friday/Saturday/
15:21 ironcamel saw someone post this: chmod 000 /usr/bin/chmod
15:22 ironcamel what do you guys thing would happen ^^^ ?
15:42 Whoop     nothing as chmod isn't in /usr/bin
15:46 larsks    Whoop: Sure it is.  /bin is a symlink to /usr/bin on recent Fedora, at least :)
15:46 Whoop     heh, wonderful
15:47 Whoop     why
15:47 larsks    Because everyone thought it was stupid to have things installed in two places.
15:47 larsks    And we're not running SunOS 15 years ago anymore.
