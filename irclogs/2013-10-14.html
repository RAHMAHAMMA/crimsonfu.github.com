00:44 pdurbin      melodie: I've used ulimit a bit to limit memory
01:25 melodie      thanks pdurbin
01:25 melodie      I finally added "mem=386M" on the kernel line and it worked
01:26 melodie      without the quotes of course :)
01:58 pdurbin      oh good
13:10 shiin        hello.
13:19 pdurbin      shiin: what's up?
13:20 shiin        pdurbin: lovely channel.
13:21 shiin        found it on google, thought Id take a look.
13:30 pdurbin      shiin: nice. comptona found us via google as well
13:32 pdurbin      mhayden: http://selfsigncert.com huh? via https://twitter.com/majorhayden/status/389290085079719936
13:54 mhayden      pdurbin: hah, i've had that thing forever
13:58 shiin        mhayden: useful. I suggest filling the meta tags a bit for google. and perhaps track visitors somehow to see when you reach 10k / day
13:59 mhayden      i doubt i'll get that much traffic
14:00 pdurbin      shiin: what were you googling for?
14:01 shiin        pdurbin: salt stack racktables
14:03 pdurbin      ah. cool. used both of those. not any more
14:05 pdurbin      I'm googling for `c/e piano chord' ... now googling for slash chord
14:08 shiin        pdurbin: did you switch to something better?
14:11 pdurbin      shiin: well, I switched to Puppet because Vagrant supports it natively. I didn't switch from Racktables... I switched to a job where we don't use (or need) Racktables
14:12 pdurbin      http://www.piano-play-it.com/slash-chords.html seems like a good write up but I can't stand the ads... printing it out
14:13 melodie      hi !
14:13 melodie      pdurbin did you read and or hear about Grid-ex 2 ?
14:13 melodie      http://www.nti.org/gsn/article/massive-drill-planned-test-resiliency-us-electric-grid
14:13 melodie      http://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/17/us/as-worries-over-the-power-grid-rise-a-drill-will-simulate-a-knockout-blow.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1&
14:19 * pdurbin    needs to start #musicfu
14:20 pdurbin      melodie: I'm clicking
14:24 pdurbin      "preparing for an emergency drill in November that will simulate physical attacks and cyberattacks that could take down large sections of the power grid"
14:26 shiin        pdurbin: I see! I havent tried puppet yet. and Im only getting into racktables.
14:27 pdurbin      dunno if racktables has that API yet. hope so
14:27 pdurbin      crimsonfubot: lucky james white manifesto
14:27 crimsonfubot pdurbin: http://blog.websages.com/2010/12/10/jameswhite-manifesto/
14:32 melodie      pdurbin what do you think? Could that be a problem for the people in the US, Mexico and Canada? In another chan slystone said in a former drill some problems happened
14:35 pdurbin      what could possibly go wrong?
14:48 melodie      some impaired people died in the hot towers in Toronto when a drill occurred during a summer
14:48 melodie      ask slystone, he is aware about that
14:49 pdurbin      :(
14:52 pdurbin      melodie: ok, I did, at http://irclog.perlgeek.de/linuxvillage/2013-10-14#i_7713322
14:56 pdurbin      melodie: I've worked in IT for a long time. Everything can go wrong.
15:03 melodie      pdurbin it's nice to see people talking together without me in the #linuxvillage chan, it means it's starting to be alive ;)
15:03 melodie      I have go, things to do.
15:03 melodie      wishing you a nice day!
15:06 * pdurbin    has started a few channels that aren't much alive

15:24 pdurbin      on day 1 I put a lot of energy into http://irclog.greptilian.com/spanworm/2013-02-08
15:25 pdurbin      same with http://irclog.greptilian.com/wonderstudy/2013-05-11
