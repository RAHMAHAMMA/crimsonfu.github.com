19:41 pdurbin what's the best chat tool that allows for public discussion?
19:41 pdurbin IRC when it's publicly logged?
19:41 pdurbin or is there something better?
20:40 pdurbin oh yeah, there was https://slack.com but I still haven't tried it
20:41 pdurbin "real-time messaging, archiving and search for modern teams"
21:30 Whoop   slack isn't public
21:30 Whoop   its awesome though
21:31 Whoop   depends what you meant by public I guess, slack is awesome behind a login, every channel is indexed and searchable - full log replay when you join a channel etc
23:46 pdurbin Whoop: ah. not public. oh well
