01:09 pdurbin  agoddard: i'm starting to listen to you (and James Cuff) on this podcast: Saving the World with DevOps - Big Data and HPC - Food Fight - http://foodfightshow.org/2013/02/saving-the-world-with-devops-big-data-and-hpc.html
01:10 pdurbin  good stuff so far :)
01:40 pdurbin  "embrace the chaos"! :)
02:06 pdurbin  didn't know agoddard runs/ran the largest redis instance
02:06 agoddard ran :)
02:06 pdurbin  :)
02:06 agoddard we since sharded it and I'm sure others have bigger ones
02:06 agoddard it was ~44GB
02:07 pdurbin  agoddard: so glad you hear you advocate opening cookbooks, etc. i've been trying to do this too: https://github.com/dvn/iqirclog-vagrant
02:07 agoddard awnice. yeah I gotta get some of ours up on the community site
02:07 pdurbin  i.e. that's the puppet code that configures that server
02:08 pdurbin  is it on github already?
02:08 pdurbin  that's good enough
02:09 agoddard ya, needs documenting, tidying up, it's a touch useless the way it is - https://github.com/mbl-cli/NetiNeti-cookbook/
02:09 agoddard https://github.com/mbl-cli/Taxonfinder-cookbook/
02:09 pdurbin  meh. it's fine. the main thing is that it's available :)
02:10 agoddard (that redis thing was in 2009 btw)
02:10 agoddard the good old days!
02:10 pdurbin  :)
02:11 agoddard man, I was so tired on the podcast, I hadn't really slept for a few days! It wasn't long after we came home from the hospital
02:13 pdurbin  agoddard: you sounded fine. i'm checking out one of your picks: http://cartodb.com
02:15 pdurbin  agoddard: any pictures yet? or is this an offline baby?
02:16 agoddard pdurbin: you on facebook?
02:18 pdurbin  nope. that's ok. no pressure :)
02:19 agoddard this is what I'm working on at the moment w/ cartodb - http://cdb.io/Z4vh4K
02:19 pdurbin  agoddard: i had to re-listen to you talk about http://www.alastairhumphreys.com/microadventures-2/ because i spaced out and the website made no sense to me.
02:19 agoddard us academic &amp; research vessel tracklines.. like the ones you saw down here :)
02:20 pdurbin  walk or bike from your house and spend a night under the stars, like you said, makes sense :)
02:20 agoddard yep, Al needs a more succinct description on his site..
02:21 pdurbin  cool map but is it portable? can you move it to another service? or can you at least download a kml file or some such?
02:22 pdurbin  kml being http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyhole_Markup_Language of course
02:23 pdurbin  and yes, i remember that vessel: https://twitter.com/philipdurbin/status/241301720934801408
02:35 pdurbin  right, this one, the one that supported researchers when they found the Titanic: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RV_Knorr
03:02 westmaas I got highlighted!
03:03 westmaas oh
03:03 westmaas one of my teams is named "titan"
03:03 westmaas pdurbin: thanks for nothing
03:27 pdurbin  westmaas: :)
15:42 pdurbin  Getting X11 forwarding through ssh working after running su - http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/494 is a nice walkthrough of ssh -X, sudo, xauth list, xauth add
15:43 pdurbin  i'm curious about `sudo apt-get install sux` from sudo - how to use xauth to run graphical application via other user on linux - Server Fault - http://serverfault.com/questions/51005/how-to-use-xauth-to-run-graphical-application-via-other-user-on-linux/51285#51285
15:43 pdurbin  "Sux is a wrapper around the standard su command which will transfer your X credentials to the target user" -- http://fgouget.free.fr/sux/
18:56 pdurbin  mattdm: you around?
18:56 mattdm   pdurbin yep what's up
18:56 pdurbin  any fedora base boxes for vagrant yet? :)
18:57 mattdm   not from me but there *are* some on the list at http://www.vagrantbox.es/
18:58 pdurbin  oh! hmm. i wonder if these are new
18:58 pdurbin  thanks!
18:58 pdurbin  sorry for not checking there myself first
18:59 mattdm   they are relatively new, yeah.
18:59 mattdm   also i can't actually vouch for them
19:08 pdurbin  mattdm: ok. i just replied to https://groups.google.com/d/msg/dataverse-community/r8RWtioXpT8/XjL_jJQz0n0J ... the "Several problems installing Dataverse on Linux Fedora 17" thread
19:09 mattdm   cool
19:11 pdurbin  ah, only added a month ago: Merge pull request #97 from henriquemoody/fedora17 · 383ce31 · garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku - https://github.com/garethr/vagrantboxes-heroku/commit/383ce317ce4187380a3aacee4acf7af217b36a80
19:12 pdurbin  hmm, i might use that to install netbeans on... to verify our dev guide
