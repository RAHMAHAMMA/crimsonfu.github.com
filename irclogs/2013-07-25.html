03:11 pdurbin  mhayden: hmm, you did get berated a bit. but you also got a fun re-mix: https://twitter.com/Asher_Wolf/status/360041371496755201
12:26 mhayden  hah
16:17 pdurbin  if a guy sent you 80 emails each with one attachment would you punch him in the face or write a script to download them one by one?
16:17 pdurbin  or is there an easier way? the emails were sent to a gmail account
16:21 larsks   just point mutt at gmail and download them that way?  possibly batch-forward them so that all the attachments would be contained in the same message...
16:22 larsks   then I think gmail offers a "download all attachments as a zip file" option, maybe.
16:22 larsks   use some of the gmail/dropbox integration on IFTTT.
16:23 semiosis am I the only one who thinks IFTTT is a bad idea?  too risky
16:24 larsks   Depends.  I would probably not use ifttt with my bank.  Might use it twitter.

16:25 semiosis gmail is too important
16:25 semiosis imho
16:26 semiosis pdurbin: is 'ignore the emails' an option?
16:26 larsks   Like I said, depends.  I would argue that the real problem is not with IFTTT but with the services it consumes, which in general don't provide very good granularity of permissions.  E.g., I can't grant time-limited access, or read-only access, or access only to certain labels/tags/folders/whatever...
16:29 ben_e_   was it an 80-part RAR file?
16:29 ben_e_   maybe he was pining for the days of NNTP warez
16:29 pdurbin  heh. I'd have to ask my wife. It's for her
16:30 pdurbin  thanks for the ideas. dunno if she's down with mutt ;)
16:30 ben_e_   o/~ ya down with the em you tee tee? yeah you know me o/~
16:30 larsks   Seriously, I was going there but stopped at the last minute.
16:31 ben_e_   heh
16:31 ben_e_   :-)
