03:16 pdurbin    mhayden: you like to post animated gifs. Enjoy! https://plus.google.com/+Youonlyhadonejob-com/posts
03:16 pdurbin    prologic: gopher, huh?
07:46 prologic   pdurbin, yeah gopher :)
07:46 prologic   I'm kinda getting seriously into this
07:46 prologic   you probably may (or may not) know how I'm visually impaired (legally blind)
07:47 prologic   so fancy UI (as is the web these days) and these stupid flat uis
07:47 prologic   are just terribly shit from an accessibility point of view
07:47 prologic   there is a certain appeal to gopher really
07:47 prologic   and you may know from previous chats that I'm also a UNIX as an IDE developer
07:47 prologic   vim + lots of cli apps
12:21 hydrajump  prologic: i'm also slowly getting in go. really like how you can cross compile so easily for different OSes.
12:28 dotplus    prologic: I guess you have a reverse proxy in front of your gopher service (gophernicus?); Server Information>your ip address reports '10.0.0.1'
12:29 prologic   hydrajump, gopher
12:29 prologic   not golang
12:29 prologic   dotplus, DNAT
12:29 prologic   yeah
12:30 prologic   just running it on my desktop for  now
12:30 pdurbin    the go mascot is a gopher #justsayin
12:31 * dotplus  imagines a gopher daemon written in golang
12:32 dotplus    I wonder if that is interesting enough and small enough to be a project to learn golang.
12:32 hydrajump  prologic: hehe opps
12:33 * pdurbin  is thinking about the ruby stuff called by http://podcasts.greptilian.com/go.sh for http://podcasts.greptilian.com in go
12:35 pdurbin    because it's the quickest, dirtiest ruby you've ever seen
12:36 prologic   sure could be :)
12:36 prologic   it's an easy protocol
12:37 prologic   anyway Gopher in general is really lovely
12:37 prologic   there's an addon for Firefox that gives you a nice Gopher client
12:37 prologic   and elinks has support for it with --enable-gopher (compile flag)
12:37 pdurbin    prologic: next you'll be selling us on TCL
12:37 prologic   nah
12:37 prologic   some languages should die :)
12:37 prologic   haha
12:38 pdurbin    is that the one that's supported by the <script> tag in HTML?
12:38 * pdurbin  forgets
12:38 prologic   umm
12:38 prologic   no
12:38 prologic   that's javascript :)
12:38 prologic   <script> tags in HTML don't support anything else
12:38 pdurbin    no
12:39 prologic   not without hacking the brwoser or some kind of addon
12:39 pdurbin    there is another
12:39 prologic   you're thinking SSI
12:39 prologic   Server Side Includes
12:39 prologic   but IIRC that wasn't TCL either
12:39 prologic   just some kind of weird hacked up scripting langauge
12:39 dotplus    SSI can use lots of languages it's server-dependent. remember cold fusion?
12:40 prologic   ofc
12:40 prologic   but I think many web servers had some builtin too
12:40 prologic   not sure :)
12:40 prologic   who users that anymore anyway
12:40 dotplus    I think java or some MS thing were the most common
12:40 pdurbin    'In this example, we declare the default scripting language to be "text/tcl".' http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/interact/scripts.html
12:45 dotplus    do the regular search engines (duckduckgo, google, yahoo, baidu, yandex, bing, did I miss any big ones?) crawl gopherspace?
12:48 pdurbin    dotplus: you mean like how google indexes nntp
12:48 dotplus    uh, yeah. the more common example would be how google crawls/indexes http servers :)
12:49 prologic   that's a very good question
12:49 prologic   if you find the answer, speak up :)
12:49 prologic   I'm not sure myself
12:49 prologic   I know there are Veronica-V2 and VISHNU spiders/crawlers that crawl Gopherspace
12:49 prologic   they seem to be the two main Gopher search engines
12:50 pdurbin    dotplus: well, for nntp google renders it as html
12:50 prologic   that's cheating :)
12:51 dotplus    it's still useful and sorta counts. presumably they return links/pointers to the sources, right?
12:51 pdurbin    prologic: so is http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=crimsonfu :)
12:51 prologic   dotplus, yeah they do
12:51 prologic   pdurbin, true :)
12:51 prologic   you know guys
12:52 prologic   it woudln't take much for a bunch of smart guys like us to revitalize Gopher :)
12:52 prologic   put a new spin on it for the new young hipsters that are all social this and social that :)
12:53 prologic   IRC has been bastardized that many times now over the past decade I've lost count :)
12:53 mhayden    pdurbin: hah, thanks for the gifs
12:54 dotplus    I sort of assumed that there is still an existing core of gopher-folk, that it never exactly died, just that the rest of the world forgot about it. perhaps I'm wrong?
12:54 pdurbin    mhayden: only the best for you, my friend
12:54 mhayden    i'm working on getting approval to go to the summit this year in boston, will hopefully present on something
12:55 pdurbin    mhayden: nice! look me up. oh, and go all the way back to the beginning (like I did) and fine the one with the sea lions
12:57 prologic   ahh
12:57 prologic   my root menu is looking much nicer now :)
12:58 dotplus    prologic: certainly there are enough smart tech people who decry the state of the web and yearn for the attitudes of days of yore where everything was text based and wasn't solely for the benefit of GovCorp that a renaissance is possible.
12:58 prologic   hmm
12:58 prologic   tbh I only started with Gopher seriously last night
12:58 prologic   I've known about the protocol somewhat for years
12:59 prologic   but I started out by Internet days with IRC back in '97
12:59 prologic   but didn't have the pleasure of finding out or using Gopher at the time
12:59 pdurbin    dotplus: you should check out http://indiewebcamp.com
12:59 prologic   Netspace ruined that :)
12:59 dotplus    netscape?
12:59 prologic   dotplus, agreed
13:00 prologic   I'm a web developer approaching 2 decade
13:00 prologic   and I'll be the first one to say
13:00 prologic   the Web is broken
13:00 prologic   very very broken
13:00 prologic   Gopher just reminds me of what the original internet of the Internet/Web/Gopher really was meant to be
13:01 dotplus    pdurbin: I have heard that name occasionally. in theory, I think I remember that it would be an awesoem direction to put some of my effort, but I just don't see to have any spare.
13:01 pdurbin    prologic: you could be a 3 decade gopher dev by now
13:01 prologic   haha
13:01 prologic   I doubt I'd pay my mortage that way :)
13:01 prologic   :P
13:01 pdurbin    dotplus: you can find me swaying here: http://indiewebcamp.com/File:iwc-cambridge-sway.gif
13:01 prologic   there are limits to what a sole man can do :)
13:02 mhayden    anyone here doing anything with power8?
13:02 mhayden    or as i call it, "The Ocho"
13:02 pdurbin    oh, larsks and codex: check this out: https://twitter.com/philipdurbin/status/543218908342546432
13:02 dotplus    prologic: not a web developer, but a sysadmin. currently, creating automation to manage various corp clouds.
13:03 prologic   yeah
13:03 prologic   hmm
13:04 prologic   here's an idea
13:04 prologic   version my gopher with git/mercurial
13:04 prologic   :)
13:04 prologic   gives you "last updated" and a "revision history" for freee
13:04 prologic   :)
13:05 dotplus    pdurbin: previous one in Brighton, UK. yeah that sounds about right, that sounds just the kind of (counter)cultural effort that would thrive there.
13:06 * dotplus  misses Brighton in many ways.
13:06 dotplus    that was the nearest big town for my teenage years
13:08 dotplus    ok, enough nostalgic brain-idling on gopher and brighton. must do stuff before baby wakes.
13:09 dotplus    prologic: everything should be version controlled. git is a reasonable choice. no reason why you should stick with rcs just because you're using ancient server protocols:)
13:09 * dotplus  gone
13:10 prologic   the protocol might be ancient
13:10 prologic   actually that's not quite true
13:10 prologic   it's had updates in recent years
13:10 prologic   Gopher+ for example
13:10 prologic   and Gophernicus is one nice server
13:11 prologic   last released this year v1.6 I think I'm using
13:11 prologic   rock solid
13:11 prologic   :)
13:49 prologic   So far, Veronica-2 has found 3084856 unique and verified selectors,
13:49 prologic   generated by 150 unique servers (counting host and port pairs).

19:10 tfhartmann ooh
19:11 pdurbin    tfhartmann: don't tell me you're into R and latex ;)
19:12 tfhartmann I am when you make it sound all sexy like that
19:12 pdurbin    heh
19:12 pdurbin    I'm actually pretty happy I got all this working.
19:12 pdurbin    took it from a developers laptop and made it run in the cloud
19:13 tfhartmann R has been on my radar a bit more, we have a project called Distributed R
19:13 pdurbin    so she doesn't have to do it manually any more
19:13 tfhartmann https://github.com/vertica/DistributedR
19:13 pdurbin    huh. didn't know you were on github
19:13 pdurbin    tfhartmann: oh hey, check this out: https://twitter.com/philipdurbin/status/543218908342546432 :)
19:46 pdurbin    anyway, DistributedR looks neat. I dropped a couple links to people
19:53 tfhartmann just released a new Splunk Puppet module :)
