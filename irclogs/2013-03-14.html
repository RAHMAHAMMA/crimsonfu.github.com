00:01 pdurbin      "on July 1, 2013, we will retire Google Reader" -- http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2013/03/a-second-spring-of-cleaning.html
01:01 pdurbin      time for screen+newsbeuter I guess: http://newsbeuter.org
01:31 pdurbin      my list of Google Reader alternatives: http://irclog.greptilian.com/spanworm/2013-03-14
02:04 agoddard     pdurbin nice
02:04 agoddard     I just need something to work with reeder.app, hopefully it just starts syncing with Dropbox or something
02:11 pdurbin      it's funny... I was really into Google Reader maybe 2 or 3 years ago... but now I mostly check Twitter and Google+ ... I guess I'm part of the problem: "While the product has a loyal following, over the years usage has declined."
02:16 agoddard     ya, I never use the web app anymore, once I started using reeder I stuck with it
02:18 pdurbin      reeder?
02:19 agoddard     crimsonfubot lucky reeder
02:19 crimsonfubot agoddard: http://reederapp.com/
02:20 pdurbin      good old crimsonfubot
02:20 agoddard     :D
02:20 pdurbin      agoddard: so you use the mac and mobile versions?
02:20 agoddard     yep
02:26 pdurbin      I was just thinking I should send crimsonfubot into all the channel I hang out in
02:26 pdurbin      I'm still a little stuck on the idea that there might be a better bot.
02:27 pdurbin      semiosis: you didn't sound very excited about hubot though: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2013-01-10#i_6317262
02:27 pdurbin      so maybe i'll stick with subybot
02:27 * pdurbin    pets crimsonfubot
12:01 pdurbin      heh. Hitler finds out Google Reader is shutting down - YouTube - http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A25VgNZDQ08
12:01 pdurbin      agoddard: reeder gets a mention at the end :)
12:37 * pdurbin    looks at http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image_Packaging_System (IPS came up in #glassfish)
12:39 pdurbin      a guy in there says it's cross platform: http://www.evanchooly.com/logs/%23glassfish/2013-03-14
12:43 pdurbin      whoops, i meant to say supybot, earlier. http://supybot.com
14:06 semiosis     i use google reader a lot, sad to see it go
14:07 semiosis     this morning i set up &amp; played with flipboard, and while it's neat, i dont think it's going to be a good replacement for me
14:09 pdurbin      i like the comparison of twitter as live TV and google reader as, um... something else.... something you can go through more methodically so as not to miss stuff
14:17 sjoeboo_     reader has been my rss app for years and years now....just clean and something i can read on one device, and know things are in sync (interms of whats read/starred) where every else i want to read it
14:18 sjoeboo_     really sad to here i need to find an alternative now
14:20 pdurbin      I'd be sad if Google Calendar went away... at least there's the option to pay for it
15:38 larsks       I think Feedly is a great alternative to Reader.
15:39 larsks       I've been using it to read my Reader subscriptions for months.
17:53 * pdurbin    makes noise about merging specific files with git: http://irclog.greptilian.com/sourcefu/2013-03-14#i_4019
18:20 StripeyType  theoldreader.com is quite good, but as you might imagine, currently-slammed.
18:22 pdurbin      StripeyType: full urls please :)
18:23 StripeyType  Oh yes. http://theoldreader.com/
18:23 pdurbin      thanks :)
20:51 JoeJulian    Heh, you end up with "Happy Smurf"? https://twitter.com/JoeCyberGuru/status/312298141510664192
21:15 pdurbin      compute smurf
