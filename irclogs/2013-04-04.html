00:04 pdurbin      melodie: you know what I like? http://blogs.perl.org . It's a place where anyone who likes Perl can have a free blog on a common domain. I haven't seen this for other languages.
00:07 melodie      ok
00:10 pdurbin      and the cool thing is, if you have something to say about Perl, and you put it on that site, people actually read it. They read everyone's blog on there from what I can tell :)
00:10 pdurbin      even mine: http://blogs.perl.org/users/philip_durbin :)
00:19 melodie      pdurbin : the fonts in the h2 class is terrible
00:19 melodie      you might want to try something else ?
00:19 melodie      at least in Firefox it looks terrible
00:20 melodie      all the rest has a good look
