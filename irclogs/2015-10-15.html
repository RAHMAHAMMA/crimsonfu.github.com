01:45 pdurbin   mhayden: https://major.io/2015/10/14/what-i-learned-while-securing-ubuntu/ is really good. I'd be curious to know if you ended up configuring a firewall (and if so, how).
01:50 mhayden   pdurbin: thanks -- sounds like most folks use that iptables-persistent package
01:51 mhayden   i really dislike ufw
01:51 mhayden   a kernel dev i know told me "i used to use ufw but then i lost my box of crayons"
01:51 mhayden   but yeah, this security on ubuntu experience has been rough
01:53 pdurbin   searchbot: lucky iptables-persistent
01:53 searchbot pdurbin: https://www.thomas-krenn.com/en/wiki/Saving_Iptables_Firewall_Rules_Permanently
01:54 pdurbin   I've been playing with Ubuntu a bit (again) and I was surprised that there was no firewall by default.
01:57 pdurbin   ok, looks like iptables-persistent is listed on both of the pages I bookmarked. brief mention at https://help.ubuntu.com/community/IptablesHowTo and more detail at https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-a-firewall-using-iptables-on-ubuntu-14-04
07:26 hydrajump interesting read mhayden!
07:27 hydrajump Don't know if I've asked you already, but have you played with Alpine Linux http://www.alpinelinux.org/ ?
07:28 hydrajump I've started to use it for some project instead of ubuntu and really like the minimalism. Services don't start automatically as you mentioned on Ubuntu and you have to explicitly configure them to start on boot.
07:36 hydrajump Are you worthy? http://www.cnet.com/news/engineer-builds-working-thors-hammer-only-he-can-lift/
12:22 mhayden   hydrajump: i've heard of it, but that's about it
13:24 larsks    hydrajump: I love alpine for building docker containers...
13:27 hydrajump larsks: have you used it for non-docker use-cases?
13:28 larsks    hydrajump: I built a cloud image out of it that I could boot in openstack and have it autoconfigure an ssh key...and that's about it.
13:29 larsks    I like it for docker because it's not really any bigger than the busybox images, but has a functional package manager.
13:29 hydrajump yeah that's true
13:29 hydrajump what host OS are you using for your docker workloads?
13:29 larsks    I'm running Fedora 23 on my laptop, which is where I mostly use docker.
13:30 hydrajump ok
13:30 pdurbin   I wonder if anyone is using Docker in production.
13:35 hydrajump pdurbin: there a many who've said so publicly such as Shopify
13:36 hydrajump there are many others...
13:47 pdurbin   https://www.shopify.com/technology/15934308-docker-at-shopify-how-we-built-containers-that-power-over-100-000-online-shops
13:47 pdurbin   hydrajump: thanks
13:52 hydrajump pdurbin: you're welcome ;) as I said there are many many companies using docker in production today.
13:52 hydrajump this is also a pretty cool use-case that you may find interesting https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Au_8wWA0ZQI
13:59 pdurbin   hmm. "Containerising scientific software leads to fungible scientific methods which can be objectively compared and easily interchanged."
13:59 pdurbin   yeah, skay might be into that too
14:09 skay      pdurbin: url?
14:10 pdurbin   skay: the youtube link ^^
14:10 skay      thanks
