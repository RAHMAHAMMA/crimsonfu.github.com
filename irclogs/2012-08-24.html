12:36 pdurbin fascinating how the guys at github control so much of their infrastructure via a chat bot: ChatOps at Github with Jesse Newland - Food Fight - http://foodfightshow.org/2012/08/chatops-at-github-with-jesse-newland.html
12:53 pdurbin HUBOT - http://hubot.github.com/ this is what they use. they do almost everything through this. deploys, etc.
13:23 pdurbin mmm, netcat
14:48 pdurbin finding myself linking to this again: Graphs help tell a war story - http://crimsonfu.github.com/2012/07/01/graphs-help-tell-a-war-story.html
14:48 pdurbin proding our network guru to post something :)
14:48 pdurbin oooh, a new post from shuff: Using Vim to edit Puppet code - http://crimsonfu.github.com/2012/08/22/vimpuppet.html
14:49 pdurbin no mention of http://puppet-lint.com ?!?
15:13 pdurbin nice! we have a fix for this - [libvirt-users] Problem to migrate virtual machine between two hosts wit - https://www.redhat.com/archives/libvirt-users/2011-August/msg00084.html
15:13 pdurbin as previously discussed here: http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-05-10#i_5570111
15:13 pdurbin i.e. how to change the service tag on a Dell PowerEdge C6145 to allow for live migration between hypervisor blades that share a chassis
16:40 pdurbin jeez, was so excited about an anyconnect rpm (packaging of cisco's opaque binaries) http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-02-13#i_5143886 http://irclog.perlgeek.de/crimsonfu/2012-02-14#i_5147725 but it turns our openconnect (free and open source) "just works" on my fedora 17 box
16:40 pdurbin "There's no way to create a VPN connection from the network menu in Gnome Shell 3.2, but if you open the network manager connection edit directly (nm-connection-editor) then you can add them and they will appear in the gnome-shell network menu to use after that" at http://superuser.com/questions/389393/how-do-i-setup-a-gnome-3-2-vpn-connection-fedora-16
16:40 pdurbin was super helpful
16:41 pdurbin as was "Using OpenConnect and Network Manager with UC Berkeley's VPN Service" http://afs.berkeley.edu/~jeblair/openconnect/
16:42 pdurbin time to update https://github.com/pdurbin/anyconnect to advise people to simply use openconnect
16:43 pdurbin i.e. `yum install NetworkManager-openconnect` or equivalent
18:43 pdurbin error: Unsafe migration: Migration may lead to data corruption if disks use cache != none
18:43 pdurbin from this: virsh migrate --live --verbose --persistent --undefinesource $DOMAIN_TO_MIGRATE qemu+ssh://$TARGET_KVM_HOST/system
18:52 pdurbin probably new with centos 6.3: Re: [libvirt] [PATCH v2 4/4] qemu: Forbid migration with cache != none - http://www.redhat.com/archives/libvir-list/2012-February/msg00974.html
18:53 pdurbin "Migrating domains with disks using cache != none is unsafe unless the disk images are stored on coherent clustered filesystem."
18:53 pdurbin JoeJulian: they must mean gluster :)
18:54 pdurbin virStorageFileIsClusterFS. whatever that is
18:57 pdurbin our VMs are set to "default" right now. other options are: none writeback writethrough. can make it "non" like this: &lt;driver name='qemu' type='qcow2' cache='none'/&gt;
18:58 pdurbin i guess i need to read up on what the default is
19:04 pdurbin "In some cases libvirt may refuse to migrate the domain because doing so may lead to potential problems such as data corruption, and thus the migration is considered unsafe. For QEMU domain, this may happen if the domain uses disks without explicitly setting cache mode to "none". Migrating such domains is unsafe unless the disk images are stored on coherent clustered filesystem, such as GFS2 or GPFS. If you are sure the migration is safe or you j
19:04 pdurbin whoops, cut off..
19:04 pdurbin "If you are sure the migration is safe or you just do not care, use --unsafe to force the migration." -- virsh(1)
19:06 pdurbin i love that. "if you just don't care" :)
19:13 pdurbin hey, that guy i linked to from the libvir-list post is one of us. trying to use gluster to store his kvm disk images
19:14 pdurbin oh, wait. i didn't link it yet. here: [rhelv6-list] RHEL6.3 virt-manager and live migration options. - https://www.redhat.com/archives/rhelv6-list/2012-June/msg00041.html
